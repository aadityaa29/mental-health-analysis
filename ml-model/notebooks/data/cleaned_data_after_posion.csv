I am currently mooching off from my elder brother and my mother. I am also now in deep depression.

7,"I am filled with envy, pride and resentment. I will start of by saying that I may or may not be suffering from depression. Ever since I turned 21 I started feeling jelous towards my peers: profesionally, academically, relationship wise. I am 27 now and things haven't really improved.

Everytime I try to share these emotions with someone, namely my mother she just brushed them off and made no big deal out of them. Telling me to just ""man up"" basically. When I shared them with friends they either said nothing or told me to get over it.. as such I bottle these feelings because it seems to be a nuisance to other people. Fucking assholes.

I feel envy profesionally because I do not work in the places I wish to work and for positions I want to work at. I am underpaid, working a job I have grown out of for years.

Relationship wise, I barely have any friends anymore after college. No partners due to me not taking the initiative to do so. Not due to lack of confidence but due to constant daydreaming and fantasizing about being in a relationship instead of actually pursuing it.

I do not feel like an independent person, up till recently I was living with my parents and just now am learning to live on my own. I wanted this to be sooner but due to my own lack of initiative and financial struggles I was not able to.

I have been addicted to pornography and videogames ever since I was a teen. Just now I am trying to fix these issues. But its hard man... really hard after 15 years of constant use. Makes me feel disgusting. Full of hatred. But at any inconvinience or struggle, I immediately resort to these two things.

Lately I have been suffering from mood swings from manic anger and anxiety to relative peace serenity and reflection. Within the same hour even. I have also seemed to garner small panic attacks at the most ridiculous and inconsequential things that happen to me. 

I talk to myself. Alot. Alot alot over the years. For about a couple years now this self talk has turnt more negative over time. Insulting my own capability and intelligence at any mistake.

There have also been times...in which I contemplated suicide... but not seriously. Just the idea of ending it all has crossed my mind.

I dont really know why I wrote this. I guess I also have been feeling lonely.",1

15,"Diagnosed, but having doubts I'd like to preface first by saying that I'm not American.

I've been diagnosed bipolar II a few year ago during while in a psych ward. During all the years I've been seeing psychiatrists, it was brought up only once by a psychiatrist I've seen for less than a month. I've been somewhat successfully treated with seroquel. 

While I thought I had BP before my diagnosis,  this diagnosis as almost always made very little sense to me. I do have some pretty extreme mood swings, but far more than 4-5  a year and they sometimes last only hours.

The psychiatrist who followed me years never brought it up. He didn't change my meds, didn't really take any interest in my symptoms. He was pretty much happy just continuing the traitement that was prescribed to me during my trip to the psych ward. Last therapist didn't seem to believe I had any illness.

I'm seeing any therapists or psychiatrists anymore and I have stopped my meds. So far, I'm doing alright. 

I would like to know if any of you have experienced very frequent mood swings (say in the range of 50 a year) and very short episode, because I find really hard to relate to other people with bipolar disorder.",2
16,"I created CocoonWeaver to help. It’s a free, privacy focused app that sorts audio recordings, transcribed, into categories. There are numerous benefits to self talk, in particular it can decompress mental states and reduce stress. I hope you enjoy! Sometimes, it’s overwhelming to think about all the stressful things. When you let go of them, you can take solace in the fact they remain in a safe space, but no longer occupying headspace. I developed CocoonWeaver because of a dream I had. My dream was about an app that would be intuitive enough to release the many fleeting thoughts that occupy ones mind. Since then, it has been developed in to a working product, and improved with the help of kind feedback from various neurodivergent communities. I would love to take feedback from this community as well, if you have a moment to download the app and share your feedback I would be extremely grateful. 

The app is completely free and it is completely private, nothing leaves your device and everything is stored on your phone.

Thank you so much for your time! &lt;3

17,"Do you think you can be stressed/anxious and not notice? I'm talking more in a chronic sense. I've had anxiety for about 12 years now. Past 8 months have been the worst in my life, second only to being abused as a kid.

I started having panic attacks that woke me up in the night (for no reason, like this was before the hell time) and then got diagnosed with GERD within the same month. Developed hypochondria. Had to move to a massive uni to get the degree I wanted, but I was sick and exhausted and working and struggled to make friends. So im alone all the time. And there's always something that's wrong. I had low grade good poisoning for weeks because I didn't notice a fridge issue. I got an ear infection. I still have pretty persistent vertigo, though it was getting better until I got a cold during my finals, of all times.

And that's not factoring in the handful of deeply personal shit thats happened that I'm not going to blast all over the internet.

I'm seeing a therapist. I'm not on medication because it scares me, and my psychiatrist agreed that it wasn't for the best, at least right now. 

I've developed fun little heart palpitations. They're terrifying.

I'm wondering if im under such a high level of stress all the time that it's begun to just feel normal. Like I dont know what to do to ""calm down and relieve stress"" because to me, a good day is a day where I avoid a breakdown.

I'd ask my therapist but im on holiday and can't see her until January. I'll probably ask her anyways but still.",0
18,"Is there anyone else here who checks off all of the boxes for AvPD but can’t ever get officially diagnosed with it because your case just isn’t bad enough? I’m fairly certain I have avpd and have had so for the majority of my life. Like I have almost all of the symptoms down the the horrible childhood trauma that I experienced that started my downfall. Avpd is the only condition that I’ve been able to match up to down to a tee. I’ve went to therapy and discussed my issues, but it doesn’t seem like avpd is something I can ever officially get diagnosed with.

While I’m fairly certain I have avpd, my case is more mild because it doesn’t completely shut down my life. I would consider myself with high functioning avpd. Since I was young, I’ve always been lonely and had to figure out life out on my own since I didn’t have my parents or a loving family to grow up with. As a result, out of necessity I had to be financially independent and look after myself. Working and going to college was a never an issue for me. Because of that I’ve been able to give myself a good career and more or less have an ok life. My avpd is most severe in my personal daily life away from work. It’s a daily struggle for me. I also match all of the social symptoms of avpd and live a life of loneliness because I can’t get myself out to meet people regularly. Can anyone else relate?",3

A couple months ago I started losing my appetite to where I’d only get hungry in the late afternoon or evening. About a week and a half ago it stopped all together and I’m struggling to eat.

Now when I try to eat I feel so disgusted by food I’ll start gagging and have to spit out the food or else I’ll throw up. I’ve been living off ensure drinks and trying so hard to make myself eat in between 

I messaged my psychiatrist about everything that’s been going on and she said to see the doctor to rule out the flu. I went. Don’t have the flu. They did every blood test imaginable- everything came back great. I did a Covid test and that was negative. 

After telling my psych the updates she thinks it’s that I’m “not absorbing latuda effectively with my GI symptoms” I don’t think I fully understand what she means. She also suggested that I switch to Zyprexa / olanzapine instead of the latuda. 

I messaged my therapist today hoping for something else I guess and all she asked was if I started the zyprexa. 

Not eating is making me feel so weak and dizzy and I feel so sick all the time. I want to just eat normally again so bad. 

I’m just wondering if anyone else ever experienced anything like this with latuda?",2
27,"I am sad that a teenager blocked me from viewing his story. I (23F)  have a pretty okay relationship with my boyfriend's (24M) family. His mom is a devote Christian and her and  I are pretty close and his brother (let's call him Jake) and I are okay as well.

&amp;#x200B;

I follow the little brother who is 16 on Instagram and we occasionally interact (liking stories, pics,etc). Yesterday I remembered that my friends and I created a 'burner' account 3 years ago that we used to look and follow people we didn't know (crazy I know). 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I noticed that Jake was following this burner. I looked at his profile as saw a bunch of stuff posted that I have never seen before. It was typical teenage boy stuff like rap music, middle fingers in pictures, etc. but nothing that I haven't seen before. I realized that I was blocked from viewing these stories and unblocked whenever he posted other stuff. I instantly started to feel sick and uneasy at the thought him blocking and unblocking me each time. I even felt a little teary. I thought, does he think I am uncool? Old? Did he think I was going to tell his mom? I also post things with cursing etc. so I really felt confused. I know in reality it is really not that deep because I too have older adults in my life 'blocked' from viewing my story but the feeling I felt was uncontrollable. 

I don't want to feel like this anymore. I have felt similar to this in other occasions and another user asked if I had rejection sensitive dysphoria. I am not sure if I do.

TLDR: Boyfriend's little brother blocked me from viewing his story and I instantly started to feel uneasy.",4

Why does everyone feel like they are experts in what everyone else should do? Especially when something bad happens. And most of the time, it's something vague or obvious.

""Break the cycle"" ""You know better than this"" ""Just be grateful for what you have"" ""Live in the present"" ""Use the resources you've been given"" ""Make something of yourself, anything, but don't let your life go to waste"".

And every single time, they're very fucking happy with themselves. NOTHING MORE TO SAY HERE. \*Wipes hands\*

It's the worst part when it comes from someone you consider a friend. Personally, I'd expect friends to know how shit the world is and not give arrogant, vague and/or obvious advice. Why does EVERYONE do this nowadays?

I guess we all share this feeling of shame following us all around. I can't remember much of my life but I can remember almost every time I've felt shame. And I did it a lot of times. So much that even moments of my life that I had been SA are flashing in my mind all day. But other memories are just plain shame, shame of what I did in a specific moment, shame of how I reacted, what I've said, shame on how I was dressed, the way my face looked. What I recognise is that these are stupid reasons to feel shame, and I think anyone neurotypical wouldn't even think is such a big thing. I even felt shame and guilt of breaking things (because anything material has more value than me) . I legit had a panic attack once after dropping a water glass, I wanted to hold the broken glass and squeeze it with my hands until I made them disappear... I can remember most of the times I broke things.

We were cuddling so I see it as a indicator, but I feel that it’s difficult. I’m scared of “coming too strong there” but not setting frames around it makes me also feel insecure.

Should I try to look at it like a plain opportunity for my Person with AvPD to the experience of cuddling ?
Because I know you folks may have trouble forming trust within possible romantic relationships, and that It may take a lot longer.

How ever forming a relationship out of it would take a lot effort and patience and willingness equally of both.

The first three hours before the event I was feeling okay and so sure I would be going, but slowly the panic started to kick in. And I ended up shaking and crying while changing my clothes and getting ready for the evening. And then I just gave up. It sucks, I really wanted to go, the event sounded like a blast and I already bought the ticket. It all came crashing down when I realised that I don't know anyone from the event and that I had to make the effort of meeting new people there alone. I thought I could be brave and go to that place alone because none of my friends didn't want to come with me. I have gone to events before alone and it has been fine in the end even if I was super anxious about going there beforehand. I guess today was just not my day... :(",4

Well… I just wrapped up an investigation that led to the firing of a prominent leader who was well liked by all and extremely effective in their role. The incident was not only a policy issue but also a serious violation of feral regulation so termination was the only solution (per our policies).

Needless to say no one wants to speak to me because the leader has told them that I will turn on them if given the chance. It’s not that I had anything against the leader… I just have to support my family and do my job. I can’t sandbag investigations just because I like the person I’m investigating…

How do I work with people who don’t like or trust me. A few have come up to me saying “ I know it was hard and I respect the integrity it took to reach that outcome” but most that I used to talk to all the time actively avoid me…

I swear I’m not out to get people… I’ve been in a funk since this termination occurred. How should I get past it?",0

My psychotherapist sent me links to educate myself on the topic and now I feel completely UNDERSTOOD? I feel like now much much much of my crises actually make SENSE now?! I thought it was just normal in MDD to have sudden peaks of good mood, uninhibition, hypersexuality, agitation, euphoria, insomnia, energy, you name it. I thought it was normal for people with it, but now as I'm reading about bipolar everything make sense now????!!!!!! I'm so happy to (probably) have found one of my diagnoses, but it is also a lot to unpack and I'll be needing to so some work with myself to stop gaslighting my own thoughts and understand that it's all okay. I've posted about what's going on with my mental health in social media and actually found out that a LOT of my friends and colleagues are bipolar as well, and they understand me so much. At first I was sad because I thought there was no one I could talk to that would understand what I was going through, but speaking what's on your mind can actually help you even reconnect (as I did) with old friendships. I feel a lot more in peace now, and I don't even got a diagnosis yet, but I understand now that what happens with me is common and I'm not alone.

And I'm realizing through a lot of questions that there are people I just don't actually like I'm surrounding myself with?

But I can't help but think that anybody I would actually enjoy talking to couldnt possibly like me as a result. I think it's become a self-fulfilling prophecy. The more I criticise myself the more I pull back the less I interact with people and the world and the less 'worthy' I am. But the flavor of people I enjoy are the hardworking, driven nice ones. They wouldnt gossip about me behind my back, nobody cares enough to do that. But I would feel like such a charity case. When I'm doing okay it's okay.

95,"social anxiety vs avpd what do you guys think of the whole debate around whether social anxiety and avpd are the same disorder? 

of course we aren't professionals but i think we can still have our own input. i was diagnosed with social anxiety when i was 15 a month after i dropped out of school and became housebound/agoraphobic and because of that i wasnt able to understand the things i was truly struggling, nor were the professionals able to understand. when i ended up inpatient for the first time at age 17 i couldnt leave my room until i was forced to, wasnt able to talk to other patients or make friends every time i was in hospital or in some sort of program. i had online friends but then i started becoming convinced that they hated me so i ended up ghosting every online friend i had. when i was 18 i discovered what avpd was and i was amazed by how much i related to every single thing about it, even more so than i related to the diagnostic criteria of bpd which i was diagnosed with. i brought up the idea of avpd to a psychiatrist last fall and she pretty just said ""i agree"" but also mentioned that theres debate on whether social anxiety and avpd are the same disorder so idek if she changed my diagnosis or not which kinda annoys me but whatever. 

i just think from what i know about social anxiety is that well its obviously anxiety related so it deals more with anxious thoughts surrounding social activities. avpd to me is more so the innate feelings that you are inept and that there is something deeply wrong with you to the core and thats why nobody likes you therefore you stay alone. i just think they're separate things because not everyone with social anxiety experiences that. let me know what you guys think!",3

GET OVER MY FEAR OF DYING now I’m not saying I’m perfectly fine with death because I am not but I just thought to myself I can’t stop death and I just need to accept it. If there isn’t a god I won’t know about dying after if there is a God I could go to heaven which is great and who knows I could reincarnate and live life again. We don’t know so it’s the anxiety of not knowing which scares me and leaving my family behind.

Now I’m religious and I am sort of anxious in my mind that God is trying to get me to accept death so I can die soon lol but I don’t wanna die soon that’s why I’m scared off. That’s just my anxious mind thinking right ? I guess the positive way of looking at it is that God is getting me to get over my fear of death so I can live the LONG HAPPY HEALTHY LIFE that he put out for me.

148,"Choice Theory tl;dr should I read Choice Theory or should I change therapists?

So, my therapist has suggested that I read Choice Theory by William Glasser... I used a credit on audible to get it, it is a little over 12 hours long... I haven't started it yet, but what I have read about choice theory tells me I will disagree with a main premise, which my therapist and I kinda got into today...

He insists that thoughts and emotions are choices. Going so far as to say that mental illness is a choice. In regards to bipolar, if you are not having negative consequences, do you have bipolar? Because you can choose your actions and reactions and emotions and thoughts.

That medicine is a crutch and is not necessary.

He says that this gives you the power to control your life and swings and even get rid of swings.

This came up when I was asking about tools because my regular tool for dealing with intrusive thoughts isn't really cutting it for me right now (having the thought, then saying to myself, is this thought beneficial/useful/helpful to me?)

There are several things here that I am in complete disagreement with. Medicine is necessary, thoughts and emotions are not controllable (i.e. they just happen, but can potentially be directed) and, mental illness is real and not a choice.

Sure you can do things to help mitigate symptoms and try and improve yourself, but ~~I am pretty sure~~ I will always have bipolar. He has planted a seed of doubt.

I tried therapy once in the past with a therapist who came highly recommended and it just didn't go great. After one too many ""what's the worst that could actually happen?"" questions, I just really felt like they didn't understand. This was before I had the term AVPD to explain.

My question is this: How did you go about working with someone who actually understands the problem?

My guess is I'm being a bit too in-my-head about this, but I just don't want to show up to a therapist like a hypochondriac who plugged their symptoms into WebMD and now is 100% sure of their condition. But I also get the impression AVPD isn't as common as some other personality disorders, so I want to find someone who will at least have familiarity with it. But nothing shows up when I search for therapists who specialize in it directly. Are there other umbrella terms that help when finding a therapist? Should I just focus on a depression/anxiety doc or maybe one who works with other PDs like BPD? Or am I way off base and plenty of therapists will understand and just had a bad match for my first go-around?

Any suggestions or anecdotes for finding the right kind of help are welcome. Thanks in advance!",3

157,"Are we neurodivergent? I was reading the post about crapping on coping mechanisms that was posted recently and I was surprised to hear that many people consider themselves neurodivergent because of their bipolar. 

Please inform me if I sound really ignorant! 

I was under the impression that neurodivergence is an innate difference in thinking, permeating everything you do and the brain is inherently wired differently. This is most often associated with ADHD and Autism spectrum disorders. 

I personally feel that although I have a mental illness, that when well controlled and stable I am “wired” the same as most people. My therapist described an allegory that stuck for me which was “Your personality is the climate, and your mood is the weather”. 

I think that my climate is “neurotypical” and I do not identify myself as neurodivergent, more as someone who deals with periods of mental illness.

Anyways today I went a bit mute, I can’t find the energy to talk and it’s hard to communicate how I’m feeling. So today in lab, my friend was getting frustrated because she was hungry from not eating all day. And when lab was over, I kind of rushed out because I felt a panic attack going on. I went to the bathroom to put cold water on my face. She got angry at me, texting me saying “where the fuck are you?” And when she found me she sat there with a look on her face. I told her she can go to the dining hall but instead she went back to the lab classroom and started to talk shit about me to our lab partner.

But I'm very afraid of the challenging aspects of my personality and how contrary are to the abilities I need to have for these fields. I don't want to be an incompetent professional because of my characteristics and disorder. I'm extremely afraid of having to leave college again, or not being able to succeed.

And I know that there are different ways to work in these fields. not necesarilly having the most direct contact with people. But I want to have direct contact too. I had an experience in my previous major where I interviewed a person in treatment process after they finished their sentence. And I felt so passionate while doing it and I liked so much interviewing him, analyzing their protective and risk factors, to later make a treatment plan (closest experience to social work)

I'm also playing more of my video games, even though it was only 2 games, it's still a huge step for me. I'm excited to see my hobbies come back.

I don't feel like I have a hard shell like I used to. Almost everything people tell me I feel like rubs off the wrong way; whether they mean it or not.

Nothing has any point to it, we're just here to plug our ears and pretend that we're never going to die, despite also being certain of it. My whole life just fell apart, and now I can barely enjoy things knowing it'll all be gone. I keep mourning my friends and family, knowing everything I do with them amounts to nothing. No professional help or medication can change these things. Existence is just a prison where they dangle all these wonderful things in front of you, and then remind you that you'll be dead and none of it will have mattered.

229,"How to get over embarrassment over having an anxiety attack at work? So the other day I had a full blown anxiety attack at work. All of the sudden my heart started racing, my whole body was shaking so bad, I felt like I couldn't breathe, and I was terrified. The fact that this was happening at work made it 1000% worse. I was with a coworker, and had to run to the bathroom for like 10 minutes to try to calm down. I barely calmed down, but went back out to help customers. I was probably obviously shaking like a lunatic, but I did my best to work through it. I was honest with my coworker and told them what was going on.

This is a job that I've been doing on and off for several years. Nothing bad happened, but my life has been chaotic lately and it just snowballed right then and there. How do I get over the embarrassment of this happening not only in front of my coworker but customers too? I still don't know if my coworker told my boss, but if they had, I'm sure my boss would have reached out by now. The last time I had an anxiety attack this bad was about 2.5 years ago. So it's not a common occurrence, but when I go back to work I'm afraid of it happening again, or about repeat customers commenting on it. I just feel so ashamed and like a total loser. I'm in my mid twenties, this shouldn't be happening. I want to hide in bed forever.",4
230,"Feeling like an empty body with nothing inside. I’m a 24 year old female and I never developed my own personality. I also suspect I have autism because I did a lot of research and I just know my brain is wired differently. I can’t hold friendships and I hurt them because I keep them on a distance. They can’t help me and see mee struggling and getting in abusive relationships because my self esteem is so low. 
Because of this I have a lot of trauma’s. When I was a kid I was neglected by my parents because they were addicts. I lived in a psychiatrical hospital for a long time cause I tried to commit suicide. It wasn’t a serious attempt. I just didn’t know how to get out of the situation. 

Anyway I’m 24 now and I’ve learned a lot so far. Between my 18-22 I did a lot of drugs and I felt “normal”. I felt like people wanted to be friends with me because I was social and talkative and not scared at all. But deep down I knew it was fake. The friendships I build were fake. I tried for so many years to adapt myself to others just to fit in. And next to that I was in an abusive relationship. I was paranoid and stressed. Always scared they’d find out the real me. And I did this for so long I don’t even remember who I am right now. 
I am depressed, diagnosed with ptsd, AvPD and traits of borderline disorder. I asked for a psychological diagnosis for autism but they didn’t think I have enough traits to fit the criteria. I don’t really care about labels but I feel like there is something really wrong with me. 
I’m an alien in this world. It feels so alone.

Sorry for the long text. I’m prone to addiction and Im addicted to Xanax right now. I get admitted to a rehab clinic this Friday for 21 nights and then straight after that to Portugal for intense therapy. I’m glad to have this opportunity and I’ll definitely get out of my comfort zone. I know they won’t fix my problems but it’ll hopefully give me the push I need to work hard. Cause I do believe I can find out who I am and make real friends without being fake. 

I have hope and I want you to have it too💜
We’re all different with different stories but the one thing that is so important; getting out of your comfort zone. Do things that are scary. Take baby steps. Don’t set the bar too high for yourself. Everyone is different so you can’t compare yourself to others.

I tried meditation for 40 minutes a day, breathing techniques and much more of this type - but I came to the conclusion that this is not a solution to the problem, but a group control of my mind

Hope you're all doing alright today :) 

I've suffered from overthinking and general anxiety for a while. Being in my final year of university has been overwhelming to the point where I started seeking professional help. My doctor prescribed some beta blockers to me and asked me to take them when necessary - I've not thought of taking them until today.

I think I hit my breaking point today. I have way too much to do and I haven't been able to manage things well.

I’m a first year teacher; tomorrow is my formal, which is one of the most important days of the year for my career. I get evaluated on my performance.

I’ve never missed a day of work until this month; I was so sick that I was sent to the ER. That was two weeks ago. Then I couldn’t chew, my wisdom teeth were gnawing at me, and the gum over the tooth got infected. Now I have a cold as well.

Within this time, I’ve lost my gold chain, an invaluable item with massive sentimental value. I received it from my parents when I graduated from my masters. I wore it everywhere.

I haven’t been sleeping. I’ve cut off the few friends I have entirely for weeks. My co-workers know something is off, but I put on a smile at work.

I am absolutely broken. I’ve had close to no sleep these past few days. I’ve found no enjoyment in anything and have had no appetite.

I haven’t been happy for years. I have isolated myself due to the pressures of work; and have lost a lot of friendships and relationships because of it. But these past few events have been stacking on and I don’t know if I can take this anymore. I have rigorously searched everywhere for this gold chain, but I think I’ve lost it at the gym or at the library on Monday. I’ve called both.

I’m not religious at all, but this dreamlike feeling was full of images that felt like a type of beautiful afterlife, like a heaven or something.

It felt like the scenes from the Lost Boys when you see the vampires’ POV as they fly.

268,"Feeling disconnected from peers - how do I stand out to fit in? Hi, I've been struggling a lot in school from even before college and lonely for most of my life. I've been the odd one out since back when and slow on socialising - I can't seem to use social media well (too afraid that my relatives will find it) and/or hold conversations for very long even though I find people with the same interests. I've gotten responses that range from implying that I annoy them or getting told my way of thinking is... strange(?) I'm not sure how to phrase this since I tend to notice my ideas get shot down and nitpicked more than others in my friend group or even project team setting. 

I started withdrawing from my social circles as a result and getting used to living alone with myself. My family been supportive of me thus far and I shouldnt complain but I cant live like this for very long - I want to express myself and find a space for my art, craft and ideas that accepts me for me.
And I'm sure in order to be independent, I need to also be comfortable with myself.

But I'm not. I live life now never crossing the line with people even if I think its a terrible idea and is proven to be for the purpose of avoiding conflict, I withhold my ideas so as to not seem radical or stupid and avoid being berated or talked down. I feel like a NPC living a scripted life.

I have never had back problems, ever. Knock on wood, I’ve had no accidents, no sciatic issues, no joint issues, pinched nerve issues or broken bones etc.

That being said, I’ve been undergoing a lot of stress lately. The pain has been building up for a few days but tonight, I’m experiencing increased pain! Feels like the origin is the right side of my lower back and the pain radiates down through my butt cheek into my calf (pain is not travelling to foot). It‘s not a sharp pain. It’s more of a gnawing, dull but steady pain. Feels as if I’ve been punched HARD several times in the said area and I only get a bit of relief if I curl up in my side in the fetal position. 

I found literature online saying that stress can cause these symptoms but I just find it so bizarre. Am I really that fragile thay stress could cause so much havoc? I’m in my 30s. No major health issues. I did have mild covid 1.5 weeks ago though. The only other thing I can think of is the fact that I’ve been sitting a lot due to studying for exams nonstop. Weird because I’ve spent more time sitting and studying in the past, but had no back issues at that time.

273,"Being the crazy lady I’m 61 now and was diagnosed bipolar 1 at 28. It’s quite severe, I get psychotic and inhabit a whole alternate reality. Despite taking meds religiously all these years, and trying so many different combos, I still average one manic episode per year and they can go on for months. The consequences of the episodes have been serious, especially when younger. I haven’t been able to hold a job and am on disability. 

Unlike many of you that I see here I am often not able to ‘catch’ myself, and once it’s at a certain point I lose all insight and am belligerent if people try to suggest I’m not ok. Last year I seemed to have a good year and felt more hopeful and optimistic than for some time. But that came crashing down when I was suddenly arrested and dragged off to hospital in the New Year (I’d done nothing criminal but I guess I must’ve been acting strange). 

One of the hardest things for me is the shame and humiliation for how I acted when manic while being adamant that there was nothing wrong with me. In retrospect I could have been seriously harmed or worse when I used to roam around the streets at night and do risky things. Nowadays I mostly just post obnoxious nonsense online and get myself banned or blocked. I’ve lost friends, like many of us. That irresistible desire to communicate seeks an outlet, you know?

276,"Just started the process of getting diagnosed, I’ve spent years in denial despite obvious signs Hey everyone, to start I’m a 21 year old female living in the United States. I come from a family that has a close history of Bipolar and ADHD. My grandfather has pretty severe bipolar and due to his refusal to fake traditional medication he’s an addict and has been separated from my family since I was a child. 

I’ve shown signs of being bi-polar for a very long time now, was diagnosed with ADHD, got on the meds for that, but still struggled significantly. I knew everything I was experiencing pointed to Bipolar II, but with it being so taboo in my family after my grandpas actions I refused to ever admit it. 
However now after talking with my psychiatrist he strongly believes I am bipolar and we will start a more in depth diagnosis beginning soon. 

I have mixed feelings, I’ve known that this was most likely the answer but I didn’t want it to be true. I hate that I have to be the one in my family to carry the “bipolar” role, I know they will look down on me and assume I’ll end up the same way that my grandpa did.",2
278,"I have finally been able to see my anxiety and I'm heartbroken For as long as I can remember, I have always suffered from anxiety. Perhaps it runs in my family. Yet I was never able to name it or put a label on it. During COVID, it took a toll on me and the biggest hit was taken by my marriage. For past half year, so much has happened in my life that I feel like I am living someone else's life. The only good thing that has come out of it, is my ability to finally see my anxiety building up and how I channel it. I am so heartbroken to see that I mostly took my anxiety and put it in my marriage. 

Anxiety builds up in me for various reasons. Sometimes, it is related to work, sometimes things not going my way, or sometimes pretty mundane things. It slowly creeps in me and my mood is spoiled. Previously I was never able to tell that anxiety had built up in me. I would only become aware of it when I blew the lid on something. During COVID, the unfortunate victim became my spouse. I also blew up my relationship with my boss during that time. So once I spoiled the mood around me, or picked up a fight, I would see that things are fucked up. I always blamed the spouse, work or boss for the fight or issues, yet the culprit was mostly my anxiety that slowly built up and got channeled where I had hidden resentments.

It is only during past week that I have finally been able to see the pattern and it is startling. I feel so ashamed and resentful. The sad truth is that I don't see any quick remedy for this either. You see, there will always be some dormant resentments inside me. There are issues between me and my spouse, that we cannot agree on. There will always be resentment which I have how I get treated at work or how I handle more work than the others etc. And whenever anxiety builds up, it needs a channel for relief. I'm afraid my mind will always pick these targets over and over.

I have come to this community to ask for your advice, that what I feel is also how you have felt at some time? I want to take this anxiety and channel it for something constructive. I can't change my spouse, I can't get that promotion. But I can always put effort to find a new job, always choose kindness for my spouse instead of turning things to arguments. How does one make this change? How not being able to channel this energy constructively not become an anxiety in itself too? I need some encouragement and guidance. Thanks",1

Sexually compulsive 

I feel energy drained.. stress accumulated leading to failure

Stress about just anything in general.. too much of it

Difficult to have own opinion, I doubt if I even agree on the way that I feel or think about a certain topic at times. I believe this stems from stress

Depressed.. sometimes I just feel like all the light and life has been sucked out of me at random times. Occurs usually when I’m around people, and gives me a feeling of desolation like I am emotionally alone in my own world

I want to finish this with a little bit of food for thought, of what I have come to a conclusion is what doubt has done in your life and mine

Guys think of any moment you’ve felt doubt.. remove moments of doubt which you can be sure of where the doubt came from like at school while taking a test. Now every other moment where the reason for the stress feels out there in the galaxy, that’s where I strongly feel stress inhibits us and we don’t even bat an eye and question it. But why question why you are stressed.. isn’t this just part of who I am? I should learn to live with it.. it’s so difficult to live this way, we are so intermingled with stress that it just becomes a part of us and sadly we stop seeing it this way for whatever reason we have, but doubt lives upstairs from us, casting a cloud over us every time it kicks and stomps over our thoughts and our ambitions into what feels like uncaring mundanity..",3

316,"I can't stop thinking and I need to vent!! Hi Reddit, I'm here to vent about my stress, and honestly, I have no one to talk to. I am F (23), and last year I started my first ""big girl job"" as a copywriter in marketing. I originally studied filmmaking to be a screenwriter or producer, anything to get me to be on set. My love and passion for being behind the scenes and seeing the projects come to life are breathtaking. I enjoy talking to the cast, getting behind the camera, and being transported to a different unique world. So why was my first big job in marketing? 

During the pandemic, my concern was how to get myself out there when I was very limited in making connections and unable to go out and shoot because of social distancing measures due to the pandemic. The school I was in offered an internship for a class in marketing, and I took it (honestly, anything to make my portfolio and resume look good). Not going to lie; the internship was fun and exciting, so when they offered me an entry-level position in marketing, I was hesitant. I didn't study marketing or advertising or anything related to that, just filmmaking. They knew that I only had knowledge of film but still wanted to give me a chance to explore my career options. Now, having been here for a year, I've built up an extreme amount of stress.

Every single day I am constantly feeling stressed, anxious, and depressed. I'm always messing up, and it has gotten to the point where I received a PIP. I saw it coming. 

I am struggling with my grammar, not being strong enough when it comes to presenting, and lacking creativity. Things are so rushed here that I often miss a thing or two, which reflects poorly on me. Being dyslexic doesn't help either. As a result, I received a PIP, and it has spiked my stress levels and anxiety to the point where I feel sick every day. I can't eat, don't feel like getting out of bed, can't breathe, can't sleep, and can't think clearly.

Additionally, I have been struggling with a yeast infection for six months (yes, you read that right). My doctor says I have a candida overgrowth, so I am on a strict diet in hopes of getting it under control.

The whole experience is making me feel like a failure, like I've made a big joke out of myself. My manager talked to me and said that copywriting marketing isn't for me because I didn't learn it, and he knows my skills lie elsewhere. I agree, but I am afraid I won't find a job in film with how the economy is and the difficult hiring process I see on social media. It's terrifying. How am I going to pay for school, debt, help my parents, pay for groceries for this stupid candida diet, and help my grandma in Mexico, and more bills?

My parents and a coworker of mine are giving me words of encouragement and saying that everything is going to be okay. They say I should still be proud because I tried something new, created a new set of skills, and toughened up. I don't know if that's true.",0

i know i really shouldn't but.. what if i just smoked some weed? chugged some energy drinks? triggered a manic episode and stayed up all night and all day. could i time it correctly? no, probably not. i've done this before and it never ends well. maybe the trick is more weed?

it's either live a stable life, slightly depressed for a bit but getting better, or ruin it all my purposely triggering manic episodes that LITERALLY DAMAGE MY BRAIN. why am i even considering the latter? why do i keep doing this? this isn't even the bipolar this is just me being shit and making bad decisions.

352,"Turning into alcohol Hey all. I'm getting worse. I've been battling depression ever since I finished high school, and it's been progressively getting worse. I thought getting a girlfriend would fix it, it doesn't. Nothing seems to help. I've come to realize life is pointless and it doesn't matter what I do to myself. I've been hurting myself, cutting, etc. and lately I've started drinking.

 It started with just a couple of nights of drinking on holiday. Then I realized hey I kind of like alcohol. Started to have a couple of beers a few times a week. Now I'm having them every night and bought my first large case of them ""just in case"" I wanna  have some beers the next night. 

I know this is a step to the worse and that I could stop right now with minimal discomfort. I just really don't care anymore and I want someone to notice I'm not okay because I can't really talk about it myself to the people I know. At the same time I don't want this to turn into full blown alcoholism because that would be bad, but at the same time I don't know if I even care that much anymore.

If I didn't have my family I would more than likely end my life.

An accumulation will almost always end up in a high stress level. Therefore, we must be able to dump all of our concerns from the previous day or days and concentrate  wholly on our today.  If you are having trouble sleeping, there are a few steps you can take to help your body naturally get to sleep. First try to get to bed at the same time every night your body runs on an internal clock and if you don't get to sleep every night at the same time you can through that clock out of whack so a regular bedtime routine is good practice even if you aren't tired try to lay down maybe read a book or listen to some relaxing music. Lifestyle choices will affect your sleep as well such as smoking, illicit drug use and pharmaceuticals, alcohol and caffeine; try to limit your intake of such things for better sleep. Next in line is nutrition, a combination of herbs and vitamins can help naturally relax the body and mind to help one get better sleep all night long. Green tea is an herb that is loaded with the amino acid l-Theanine, studies have shown l-Theanine to can help calm the brain, given todays high pass lifestyles most of us are still thinking about work or what needs to go on your grocery list while laying in bed, l-Theanine helps calm your thoughts for a better nights sleep.

So essentially, I’ve been doing self sabotage. 

Now, the problem is that I’ve had quite a lot of absences at school, the teachers all know about some of my mental illnesses and have suffered because of it. 

I’ll need references for the application process, I don’t have anyone else to do that other than my teachers but I feel that asking anyone to do it would be putting them in a really hard position because they don’t want to lie to an institution about me being a valuable addition when they (think they) know I’ll only mess things up. 

Honestly, I just feel like even if I end up getting an internship somehow (would be a miracle in the first place) I’d somehow find a way to burn out and mess up once again.

I feel so alone. I should be used to it but ever since I've got friends, I want to spend time with them. It doesn't help because we have a huge fight and I keep overthinking it. I wanted to feel better because I somehow convince myself my feelings are fake and that I'm doing it for attention. So, I took a pathology test, and the result was too much for me. The questions felt so attacking and my stomach hurt every time I clicked a yes or a no. The result was that it is 90 % sure I have anxiety. My stomach dropped seeing that.

Which I did for about 3-4 years and then I started feeling the urge to have someone else in my life and see what it feels like to be with someone else than my wife. I went down the worse path, I lied to someone about my marriage being in turmoil and how I still feel neglected by my spouse. I started giving more time to the affair over calls and WhatsApp, instead of providing the necessary time to my wife and daughter.

Recently everyone found out about this, as the woman I was involved with was talking to me while her husband was home. Now her husband informed everything to my wife. I am constantly trying to say sorry and ask for forgiveness. My wife is talking to the other women and she is providing more details about what I used to say and not. 

During this affair sometimes I will feel weird about patching up with my wife but will stop myself and withdraw myself because I used to feel it was unjust to her while I am in another relationship. To touch her kiss her or even say I loved her. I am this horrible human being and I feel I don't deserve any of them. 

Now I have a hard time just living let alone working. I wish my wife forgives me. I tried talking her into marriage counseling but her point is you have mental issues, why should she suffer?

Cant look into my daughter's eyes (she doesn't know anything). Same with Mom. My only support system in the world after I lost my dad this year was my brother. He knows everything about this now and is withdrawn from me, and anyway, he lives in a different country.

I know that the stress of dealing with my addict ex plus the stress of the divorce absolutely contributed to the severity of these episodes so I’m hopeful that moving forward I will continue to be well managed.

I seem to have a general lack of interest in exploring anything in my life. If 0 is “I hate it” and 10 is “I love this and will skip sleep to do it”, the highest I can get is like a 7. Even with the things I “love”. Which sucks. Because often times people bond thru shared hobbies but you have to be passionate enough about that said hobby to actually fit in. And often times I’m just not that into it as the people around me. 

One simple example is when I tried playing DnD. It just made me uncomfortable because everyone was so into it and I wanted to be as well, but idk it felt like there was this barrier between me and having fun. And I get that it might not be my cup of tea, but like, this happens with everything I try

432,"Changing diagnosis? No longer bipolar? Hi,

I was first diagnosed with bipolar type 2 in 2019. I quickly got stable with medication until I was pregnant in 2021 and my meds were changed. It set me spiralling and I saw a new psychiatrist who again diagnosed bipolar type 2. 

I came off my meds for 6 months last year and stayed pretty stable other than depression. Then around Christmas time hit a manic period and saw a new psychiatrist. This time they said they weren't sure bipolar was the right diagnosis but put me on lamotrigine anyway. 

I've been really good on lamotrigine for a couple months but my husband spoke to my psych nurse today about maybe having some counselling and she said I don't have a diagnosis of bipolar anymore and they're treating my autism and depression. 

I don't know why I feel so panicked and upset by it. I think it's come out of the blue. The fact nobody has told me and they've now told my husband without even speaking to me about it. It feels like they've been sort of talking behind my back and think I'm lying or something?

I've been trying to reach out for help for 7 years now (I'm 21 now). I've been trying to tell my mom what's happening, telling her why I can't seem to get out of bed for days on end sometimes, telling her that I need help, and everytime the conversation happens it feels like she finally gets what I'm saying. She never does. Everytime she gets upset at me she asks why I'm always in bed, why a person my age is always tired and never really doing anything or going anywhere,  and Everytime it just makes me feel both worse and insane. I've straight up told her that I've thought/attempted suicide before and all she had to say was ""oh really?"" in a tone that suggested that I didn't have it hard enough to do that.

I thinking of everything but nothing at the same time. Like I really can’t catch my thoughts or even think anything logically or sensibly. And I feel like a zombie, just do everything based on experience and instinct.

And the worst part is, people don’t understand that because you look completely normal and functional. They think you’re fine now because you stop crying or being depressed. You can finish normal tasks or conversation because you are in autopilot mode, but when it comes to something that requires more brainpower, you are broken.

Today, I had to go to the doctor and ofc it was high, but I was also having a panic attack while they were checking it because of the nerves I have around the whole thing and already had to walk 3 miles just to get there. I wasn't even there over my blood pressure. Anyway, after the visit I was sobbing and hyperventilating the whole way home. I just don't know what to do.

I’ve gone from being a textbook AvPD with such bad social anxiety I barely left the house an could barely order a cheeseburger.
All through school people called me “socially retarded” and my mom thought I was autistic.
To now being a very socially skilled, confident, outgoing person who makes friends easily.

I see a lot of people struggling and feeling hopeless on this board.
It breaks my heart when I see people truly believe that recovery is impossible (and spreading that false message). It is possible! It’s just really hard, uncomfortable, takes a lot of time and you have to really want it.

Thoughts on whether a write up is something people would be receptive of? I’m also open to suggestions of what else could help.

P.S. I feel vulnerable writing this post in fear that people will have an angry, skeptical reaction or think I’m being narcissistic.

Everything has become obscurely pointless, I feel like I'm wasting my life on ""temporary"" things... A  part of me, just wants to stay in the dark and discover the vast illusion of suffering- while the other part, wants to start and become something grand.

There have only been a few times where I’ve stood up and tried to prioritize myself and it always ended in a dumpster fire. I always get put down, by others and myself. I feel like the universe is trying to punish me for trying to care about myself. I’ve been looking into what I want to do career wise and I’m leaning towards my dream job and becoming a mortician. I’ve never told anyone about my interest in the job because I know people will be very judging about it. I was talking to my mom earlier about career stuff and I got brave enough and told her about it. You can probably guess how she reacted. But she didn’t nearly react as harsh enough as my dad did. He walked into the room as we were talking and mom looked at him and went “She wants to be a mortician”. He instantly stopped moving and stared at me for 2 whole minutes with this absolute disgust on his face. He already made me feel like a disappointment without him opening his mouth yet. After what seemed like an eternity he said in a low and disgusted tone “You’re kidding me” then slowly turn around and walked away like I pissed him off or something.
People have reacted in that similar fashion to a lot of my interests. I know that field of work is looked in a taboo way by some people but I haven’t had such an unsettling, judgmental, self esteem killing reaction like that in a while. I don’t know why it hit me as hard as it has but it did. 
How am I going to be able to function if I can’t handle people reacting about what my passions are like that? Every time I try to climb out of this abyss, I get hit with the tiniest pebble of judgment and it causes me to lose my grip and fall down deeper than I was before and the cycle just continues.

2nd time was last june 2022 was falling behind online class, thought i couldn’t get set up this program until teacher helped lol and i think this was the main cause of stress (fear of being unable to catch up? Lost?) also deep slow breathing didn’t work here. How to manage lmao

Most recent was few days ago, no leg shaking but just like the 2nd time can’t really think straight, brain wasn’t calming down even though i was breathing normally. Again it was a school related thing, had an IT issue i couldn’t fix, couldnt login to join lecture that was ongoing at the time. Feared missing out important content until i remembered i can watch the recording later but didn’t really get rid of that unpleasant rushed feeling and anxiousness that i need to get this login resolved.

I’ve tried getting a new job, but due to my depression, I can barely make myself go to the mailbox and get the mail more than once per week. I’ve only left my house once in the last 2 months. I’ve had 2 interviews lined up but I couldn’t make myself go. 

So, a couple weeks ago I had the idea to start a business. I failed to get any investors, so I said fuck it and started using my credit cards to buy the tools and equipment I need. 

I’m currently just about out of money, and I’m nowhere near ready to start the business. Making and selling things, basically is the business model. 

I’ve been really starting to feel the full weight of this decision and the pressure to not fail is insane. I don’t know what to do if I fail.

My dog and my dad (he lives in another state and has health issues and he’s pushing 80) are the only things keeping me from swallowing the old bottle of ambien in my cupboard, pulling my car into the garage, and just letting it all go.

The part of me that wants to live is getting smaller everyday. I’ve discussed all this with my therapist and one friend, but even then I have a habit of sugar coating things. 

I just don’t know what to do. I feel broken and empty inside. Out of nowhere I’ll just break down and cry. I can’t remember the last time I thought “hey maybe things are gonna be ok”. 

I guess that’s the end of my rant. Thanks for reading this far. Take care, everyone!",1

516,"my bipolar is mostly just ✨spicy depression ✨ Sure, I get some highs (cyclothymia) but at this point most of my short life was spent in depression.

I tried most flavours of depression : there is the burnt out one, the high functioning one, the low functioning one, the one where you lay in bed for weeks, the one where you pretend everything is fine but you just stare at a blank wall all day, the one where you can't speak anymore, etc

And I only got a sprinkle of highs. I know I shouldn't wish for more highs but the lows are so goddamn low, I just want to get at level 0. Hypomania is not a side dish in my plate : it's barely a spice. 

So spicy depression is my lot. I feel I'm always pretending to believe it's gonna be okay. 

So yeah. Bad day today. Bad meal. 

Maybe I'm just a terrible cook.",2
517,"Splitting (?) in AvPD?? (18F) just a disclaimer, I haven’t been formally diagnosed yet but I relate to AvPD in so many ways that I can’t dive into right now. I relate way more to AvPD than social anxiety but of course idk for sure.

But anyway, I was wondering if people with just AvPD experience something like splitting (that occurs in BPD) after feeling like someone’s rejected them or criticised them.

For example, I was having a job interview and the people interviewing me seemed really nice and I really really liked them, but as the interview went on I felt like their body language and tone of voice showed they were criticising and judging me. After I felt that, it’s like a switch flicked and I hated them. Absolutely hated them. I was so mad internally and all I could think of was how mean they were (even tho they literally didn’t do anything). I was so angry and I just wanted to break down and cry because I also hated myself too for embarrassing myself and looking weird and ruining my chance to get hired.

Anyway, I got the job and I love them again and can’t even imagine ever hating them. This sort of thing happens to me all the time with almost everyone in my life and it’s so confusing!!! Except I thought it was only a BPD thing, or could it be a mix of both or complex PTSD??

Does anyone else experience this often too?

I feel so angry and anxious lately too because I feel as if everyone hates me and that they're happier without me. My friends hardly talk to me lately.

I know it's not healthy to expect one person to be my entire social life, but I literally don't have anyone else I can talk to about anything.  
Yesterday I found out that she's been lying to me by saying she's meeting up with friends from school and sleeping over at her bff's apartment, when in fact she has a rich foreigner boyfriend and she's been staying over at his place. He's also been driving her on trips to nearby cities.  
I knew this day would come; my little sister had to grow up someday and get a boyfriend, but I wasn't prepared to feel so alone, abandoned and betrayed.  
She never mentioned that guy to me and my father; I'm disappointed that I had to find out about him from my mother.

Long term Klonopin??

I am a 20 y/o male with fairly bad anxiety. Have tried every ssri in the book none of them work and give me horrible side effects. 

My anxiety is as follows: completely random attacks, feel like I’m dying I went to the er many times. I can’t process thoughts in my head pretty much 24/7 (hard time holding conversation). I will sometimes have attacks with stressful situations at work, but I have an important job so I don’t let those attacks stop home from doing my job even tho it can be miserable. 

I have tried many different ssri, hydroxzyine which works sometimes. The only thing that has worked is Xanax. I’m prescribed 1mg, but I typically break it up and take .25-.5 as needed. The only thing I haven’t tried is a beta blocker which I will try next.

Xanax allows me to have a perfectly clear head. I don’t feel like a retard and trip over my words and feel disassociated when I am on it. I don’t feel sedated or tired I just feel normal. It curbs and prevents panic attacks for usually 6-10 hours. I have been taking it more than I should recently .25-.5 every day to every other day. I do notice some rebound anxiety on the days off but nothing too crazy.

If a beta blocker doesn’t work I will try clonazapam. I really don’t care about dementia later in life. So my question is if these drugs increase my quality of life dramatically should I really avoid them just because of withdrawls? Yes I know their hell but you don’t go through them if you are on em for long term with no intention of getting off.

Let alone self care like long showers and making a nice meal. Everything feels rushed, like time is running out. I'm never fully present when doing things and i always find my mind wandering and not focusing on the task at hand. Mentally i'm scattered with just about everything and executive function is non existent. I want my life back and I want to feel like I have time. Even if I tell myself I have time I can't just sit down and have my mind stop too. My mind never stops even if my body can't keep going",2

If I'm in a paranoid state I see figures in the corner of my eye but as soon as I turn no one is there. I've had one physical one a few years ago. I was driving and I felt someone grip my left shoulder. The only one in the car was my sleeping toddler strapped in his carseat. Tonight I thought I saw a blanket on my couch move, and I heard specifically clear as day, my fb messenger ding four times. Checked them, nothing. No spam, no requests, no calls. I'm petrified of this getting worse. They only seem to flare up when I'm under intense stress.",2

I’m tired, I’m scared and I don’t know how to end this cycle and actually do my work. I take to long to sleep and keep waking up, my back always hurts, my neck hurts like crap whenever I see people with good grades because I feel like my grades would be lower and I hate being academically inferior. I feel like I’m going to fail anyway so might as well ignore it and enjoy my time and I know it’s wrong but I am so scared and I don’t know why.",0

I truly don’t think I can keep going with no hope of ever having any connection with anyone &amp; I don’t know what to do. It’s not like I even have anything to live for *for me*.

601,"Im at my wits end I just got home and im angry again. I got angry violently angry a couple of times earlier today. I am much happier when i spend time away from home. Much happier. But when i come home its like storm clouds gather and sends me to a state that I need an escape from. I don't drink smoke or do any drugs and under the conditions it is a miracle. But I am tired of getting angry. I have little to no money. I can try to get an apartment but it will be tough. I am thinking of renting a motel until I get more money or airbnb. I just need space. Otherwise my hair will be grey.

Also when i say angry, I never express it towards my mother. But her behavior pisses me off everyday and i have done nothing but treat her with the maximum level of respect and consideration. Instead of appreciating that and recognizing her behavior she instead chooses to exploit my empathy and bring stress drama and manipulation. I don't live for free at home. I pay in peace of mind. Every interaction is a peace of mind sacrifice. I was feeling happy and then she came to the car and brought drama. Now I need to recover and due to the constancy nature of this I need a punching bag. I am tired of having to be sadistically emotionally responsible. I want to let loose and be. I just need to courage to say enough is enough and just fucking leave. I felt tired before I arrived and in less than five minutes I am now on the verge of another bout of ranting in a quiet place, hitting shit, and not being able to sleep.

608,"I don’t know how to behave in group chats and it’s destroying me mentally. So to start off, I don’t have many friends and I don’t participate in many discords, so I admit I’m a little out of practice here. But recently my three cousins decided we should all be part of a group chat and rekindle the bond we had as kids. I was all for it, they’re family and I love em, but just existing in this group chat is giving me some major anxieties. It also doesn’t help that I have absolutely nothing in common with any of them. All they talk about is work, their s/o’s and gossip. They said we would be sending each other memes but every meme they’ve sent so far have been the most unfunny monotonous tiktok reaction videos I’ve ever seen. I don’t even know how to respond to them so so far I just haven’t. Now after about 3 days the group chat is silent and I feel like they’ve silently moved on. I just know it’s going back to the usual where I only ever talk to them at family gatherings, which is another awkward thing I’m going to stress about. I really am at a loss of how to handle myself, and I fear that if I eventually get into a group chat of other friend groups it’ll go the same way. I’ve tried joining discords before of varying sizes in the past, but nowadays everyone types so fast and gets their thoughts out in seconds. I feel like by the time my brain is even able to process what was said and think of a response, they’ve already changed topics. Has anyone else here had to deal with this kind of thing before?",4

614,"Dealing with this condition. Hello everyone! This is my first time posting in this group. I was diagnosed with bp2 after struggling for years with depression and supposedly mania also. But I was also diagnosed with adhd a little over a month ago. Both felt like I was diagnosed relatively quickly. Idk if that’s a good or bad thing. My depression has always been bad especially in my teens but my best friend died of suicide when I was 18 and it got worse from there. Im currently 21 and have no will or desire to pretty much live( not suicidal I think) life just seems pointless when im always depressed, I have zero motivation to do anything. Im in therapy but it feels like it’s not helping. I was recently put on vyvanse to help with my supposed adhd diagnosis. It’s helped with my motivation a little but hasnt really done much. And every anti depressant/psychotic has either made me worse or done the bare minimum which is keeping me alive. Ive been on 5+ different medications since my bp2 diagnosis 2 years ago. Ive had maybe 2 or 3 hypo manic phases since my diagnosis but their never anything more than a day or 2 of euphoria and more motivation and a splash of poor impulsive decision making. I don’t really know where I’m going with this other than how the fuck do you guys deal with this? My lifes been at a complete stand still since I was around 16-17. I have no diploma, no job and not a single desire to pretty much be a human at this point. Sorry for the long post I just figured I’d give an insight to what life is for me. Any help/advice is much appreciated since I feel so alone and like no one understands.",2
615,"Just got over an obsessive manic episode I have been fixated on one thing in particular, rather not mention what it is but just one aspect of my life. I’ve been obsessing and it took me a while to realize I have been having a manic episode filled with fixation and anxiety. Couple years ago I would have never even recognized this as a manic episode and I didn’t during the episode now either but more as it was coming to a close and my brain felt exhausted. Has anyone else experienced fixation as a part of your bipolar? Examples are welcome!",2

Time before that I physically couldn’t sleep and I was SO excited and when we got there it’s like I was so happy it was this magical amazing place. It doesn’t matter what it is. Fairs, reading, a new game that comes out, days off. Nothing is happy or fun or interesting. Everything just feels the same and it’s so empty. I haven’t felt genuine happiness in over 2 years (and even that was only temporary when I was with my then boyfriend) and I’m so scared I might never again.",1

626,"Idk what to do with myself Just as the title says, I really don't know what to do with myself.  Both emotionally and day to day tasks. 
I was laid off almost 2 months ago now and I find myself struggling to be/ wanting to be productive, I have no interest in doing anything, and just feeling abandoned on an island. Yes I know I'm struggling with  depression,  that's nothing new in my life. 
My partner is the sole bread winner at the moment and I'm struggling with my value as a person and as his partner. He's very much an absent partner at this point. He plays his game every day all night (and the whole day on the weekends) to de-stress. He ""helps"" by doing possibly one task a day which is usually feeding the dog as I make dinner. I do everything else. I do all cleaning, shopping,  cooking, administrative,  and ect. I've had talks with him asking of him to do more and his defense is that he ""helps"" and it honestly pisses me off that he refuses to understand no matter how many ways I try to express to him I am struggling. He is a part of this household and I am not is caregiver.
Hes already not an affectionate kind of person. His version of cuddling is putting his arm on my lap for the maybe hour we spend together on the couch during dinner. And I except this about him. It just makes me feel even more removed from him when I'm struggling with my value.

I'm out of lost as to what to do. I find myself paralyzed daily. I want to work out and lose weight, but I'm too ugly to be seen in public. I want to go out and make friends, but my nuero divergences tell me I'm too weird too. I want to work on a better career, and can't do a thing except stare at my courses. Everything I want requires steps and I can't bring myself to take them no matter how hard I push.

I just needed a space to pretend that I am heard. I would love any tips if there are any out there with finding and solidifing your  self worth. Thank you.",1
628,I lie so much Does anyone else realize how much they lie to themselves and other people. I always rationalize it because I sometimes do it to protect my feelings or others' feelings but that doesn't make it any less wrong or cowardly.,3
629,"Can mania permanently alter the way you react to different drugs? Benzos don’t work for me anymore. I definitely haven’t built a tolerance, at most I used to take 0.5 once a week. I had a manic episode and was hospitalized, after I was released I tried to take rivotril to calm down and it did absolutely nothing. 

Could the mania have permanently altered my brain chemistry? I’m also a LOT more sensitive to caffeine now. I was always sensitive to caffeine but it’s gotten a lot worse, I can’t even have a Pepsi, which has a negligible amount of caffeine

It’s also changed the way I react to nicotine, I get way more buzzed than I used to. I know nicotine isn’t good but I’ve been using it as a temporary replacement for my benzos until I find out what’s happening.

Also I know it’s implied but just to be clear I only had benzos on an as needed basis",2

631,"is it avpd? for basically my whole life i have been scared to get close to anyone. getting close to people and trusting them with personal things about me terrifies me but i want to experience it so badly. i feel as if i come across basically like a cold bitch to most people because i struggle to give out compliments, or say i love you to anyone (especially family). it just feels embarrassing in a way.

another thing is that i hate it when someone likes me too much because i know that i can't give them back what they expect from me and it makes me feel so guilty. i had a very average childhood with my parents divorce when i was 5 being the only significant thing i can think of. my dad and his new wife bring up to me all the time that i'm distant and cold and that i need to make more of an effort and i'm trying my best to but even just simple things like calling his wife by her name takes so much energy out of me to the point of wanting to breakdown as it's so overwhelming.

I think my main regret with bringing it up is I feel like therapists don’t see me as reliable anymore. which is really funny because I consume a very small amount of edibles about two-three times a mo. and i don’t drink alcohol or use any other substances. but I can see it on their face that they don’t believe me. it seems like a catch 22. does it even help to be honest?",4

647,"Do therapists even understand AVPD? I generally like my therapist. I think he's the best one I've found so far. But today's session just proved that he doesn't understand. And I admit that my inability to open up is a barrier to make much progress. But I heard the same generic advice....go out. Meet people. Do something fun. And that's not BAD advice. Probably should do that. But the problem is, every time I go out, I feel anxious, self-conscious, and ashamed. I don't even think I have social anxiety. Shy but not on that level. I can handle BRIEF, infrequent, surface level conversations. Anything more than that is a no-go. So I seem more outgoing than I am. And it's like he focuses on my lack of relationships so that's what I bring up. I think it's because he's a solution-focused therapist, and he doesn't seem too concerned about the past/understanding one's self. Just do it pretty much. CBT. Opposite of feeling action. Which is all true. But honestly, I isolate because I'm depressed. Which is why I don't maintain relationships or want to put myself out there. So I don't know what to do. I don't know what my problem is. I'm just over it. Older, seasoned avpd-ers if that's a thing, any advice for me? Should I stick therapy out or just forget it?

651,"Inner monologue is brutal One problem I have with criticism, and people offering it, is that I've heard it already. A lot. From myself. I think the worst things about myself to myself constantly. 

The other night, I told myself that I'm nothing more than potential. The reason I'm lonely is because no one wants to wait around for me to finally decide to be a reality. Im walking-empty promises. That encompasses a lot. So when someone wants to ""tell me about myself"", it feels like a rerun. And they hate that. Hate that they can't get their issue off, or add their redundant nugget of truth. 

Idk if that's part of avpd. And its coming off as arrogant. It's not the critiscm itself. I don't mind. More fuel for the fire. It's the attitude that erupts in response to me being unphased. I always feel like I'm preparing myself for the worst possible things so I'm not as affected when they happen. Being one step ahead of anyone trying to hurt me.

657,"Want to resign from my job Hey all, I’m really struggling at the moment and all I can think about is resigning from my role. I’m a social worker who provides therapy to children/adolescents with complex mental health difficulties. 

I’ve been working at the organisation for 11 months now and roughly a week ago I changed my workplace location to be closer to home. It’s the same service just a different location. Oh .. and I’m acting in a senior position at the new workplace as part of a six month secondment. 

I thought that starting fresh would make me feel more motivated and confident, however, I’m still feeling like an imposter, scared and worried about criticism. Extremely terrified of social interactions too. Just knowing I have to see clients and speak to them gives me major anxiety. I’m also on antidepressants and beta blockers which help a bit but I still dread the work that I have to do.

All I keep thinking about is waking up in the morning, switching off my mobile phone and driving far away to a relaxing environment like a beach, pretending I have no responsibilities or cares in the world. I know that’s not possible though.

If I did resign I would make sure never to find a therapy role again as it’s not something I’m too keen on and social interactions terrify me. Should I keep trying to work in spite of the anxiety I experience? I think I’ve given it a fair shot and I can’t take it anymore! Any advice would be greatly appreciated.. thanks!",3

I’m always questioning my diagnosis because I feel like my mania isn’t even half as bad as some things I read. Or not even close to what is portrayed on tv shows or movies. Recently it’s been getting worse, as I’ve had strong urges to do really risky stuff. For example, I had such an urge to climb up the stairs and stand and lean over the railing where a kid jumped off. And I was gonna do it to get rid of the feeling, but then I was scared that I would continue to lean and lean until I got the urge to jump off. Same thing happened when I crossed a bridge except I did end up leaning into it. But before this episode, my mania was only feeling really confident, or believing I had superpowers, or paranoia that everyone was looking at me, and my irritation was really bad. Like I was screaming at my computer today. Just wanna know if anyone also thinks their not bipolar because their mania isn’t even half as bad as they read some peoples experiences",2

She's a famous race car driver representing our country all over the world. She now just recently joined an F1 school. I know money and her being a nepo baby (her father was also a race car driver before) helped her achieve big things, but she also wouldn't be where she is right now if she wasn't great. 

I just realized that I'm 2 years older than her and I'm about to repeat my last year of highschool (i dropped out this mid school year because of mental health reasons), and I still don't even know wtf I wanna do in life.

I'm surrounded by smart, and talented people with a future, people who will make a name for themselves and become rich in the future. People who have already carved their paths. While I'm here barely even making it through the day. I can't even go to school without wanting to off myself, while they're here working their ass off for their future.

My best friends don't even know I already dropped out of high school. I'm too embarrassed to tell them. How can I tell them? They would be too embarrassed to have a highschool dropout as a friend.

696,"Tips on how to accept my symptoms are just anxiety and start living again?? The last month has been such a struggle for me. I started having panic attacks where my heart rate would spike to 150-180. I went to my doctor in case it wasn’t anxiety and just had my Holter Monitor results come back. I had one of these attacks while on it and thankfully no dangerous rhythms were found. Just some high rates but not sustained so my doctor is unconcerned. So once again, this is all anxiety. 

My therapist thinks it’s because I started a new job last month and I’m falling back into my old health anxiety habits because “Stress compounds symptoms”. 

This has gotten so bad that the past week I haven’t even been able to leave my bed out of fear of my heart getting too high. Due to probably the fear when I cooked or did dishes my heart rate could get up to 130 then if I noticed and began to worry it went up to 160.

Now that I know I’m fine I thought I’d be okay but I’m still constantly watching my smart watch to see how high my heart rate gets then panicking when I see it go above 120 from just walking around the house but when I’m calm it doesn’t go over like 110. This happened on the Holter and it was normal. I know this is just anxiety but I can’t stop obsessing that I have a heart issue that’ll kill me. 

I just need help to take the smart watch off and stop taking my blood pressure. It’s just making everything worse. Yesterday alone, according to my logs, I took my blood pressure 50 times. I was worried because my bp was low when standing yet my heart rate was high so I thought it was dangerous. It happened again this morning and my heart rate got to 165.

Since 2018, I have been working as a part-time student advisor making less than $20k annually as I was very undecided about the direction my life was going to go and it was like this for 2 years until I decided to return to college to take prerequisite courses for graduate school so that I can get into a data science graduate program. 

I'm currently in my program right now and I have been keeping a 4.0 GPA and this gives me a lot of hope but I've noticed that some of my friends (including my love interest) make much more money than I do and have their own places. My love interest told me that I will eventually get out of my situation and we still had very passionate sex when I last visited him and we exchanged our gratitudes for each.

But its like, I'm very disappointed at myself for allowing myself to be where I am today. If I had known from the beginning just how much my socioeconomic status would affect my prospective friendships/relationships, I would have taken things more seriously and considered a field that was more lucrative when I was an undergrad.",1

749,"Dealing with the Critics in Your Life Whatever you’re trying to achieve - save the world, write a novel, devote yourself to a particular cause – there are likely to be those who will be critical. Some people just have a critical disposition while others will take issue with the specifics of your particular endeavour. Criticism is unavoidable. Your choice is in how to respond to it. 

### Consider these strategies for managing the critics in your life:

**Clarify your purpose.** As humans, we are compelled to make meaning. Making meaning for ourselves – and value for others – is fundamental to a life well lived. When you’re doing something very important to you, you care far less about the criticisms of others. If they can easily throw you off your path, you might want to reflect on how important it really is to you. Are you living your purpose consistent with you values?

**Understand the critic’s motivation.** Are they projecting themselves in to the situation – their aspirations, their skill set, their propensity for risk, their values? Are they genuinely trying to protect you from any potential down-sides? Are they trying to maintain the status quo – for you, them or both? Are they masking their own lack of action? 

**Recognise that criticism is not balanced appraisal.** We have evolved to notice negative issues more readily than positive ones. We are more likely to notice criticism than encouragement: people working against us over people supporting us. Most people are actually indifferent to you and your life so get on and live it.

**Realize that you’re going to be criticized no matter what you do.** Whether you become a billionaire, movie star, teacher, doctor, or sit on the couch all day, there is someone that will tell you that you’re doing the wrong thing. So, live your life building towards what you do want rather than what the critics don’t want.

**Respond calmly.** Rather than giving your critics the pleasure of an emotional response, respond kindly with a considered response. Acknowledge any leaps of faith you are making. 

**Use your critics as motivation.** While some people are intimidated and deflated by the critics of the world, others are able to use the negative comments as a source of motivation. Remind yourself that while the critics are standing on the sidelines, you are on the pitch and playing the game.

**Decide if they have something useful to say.** Some criticism may carry valid points – explore these with your critic and ask what their solution would be – the response differentiates between useful and harmful dialogue. If the criticism isn’t useful, move on. You have more important things to do.

**Take criticism as a compliment.** Most people will leave you alone if you’re struggling or aren’t doing anything noteworthy. You only become a significant target of negative comments if you’re doing well. If you’re taking a lot of heat, you must be doing something correct!

**Live your life without the need for the approval of others.** Live your own life, by your own values. Use your signature strengths to create meaning for you, value for others and legacy for the future in your chosen pursuit.

I'm only 18 years old and I do stress and I have had anxiety before but not that I've had a full on panic attack I feel like it's taking over my everyday things.

Last night I had one and this morning when I woke up I almost had one but I managed through it.

So far I've been outside and that helps me but doesn't make it go away fully.

I went to eat at a restaurant and right when I walked it I got panicky and couldn't eat my food because I couldn't hold it down and I had to swallow the 2 bites I did take WITH WATER.

I know this is temporary and I plan to work out and get a therapist and MAYBE take meds but is there anything I can remember to know for next time?

It hasn't been a full week and I've had 2 panic attack and almost another.

I'm anxious about being anxious cause that will trigger a possible attack

Panic attacks make it feel like I'm having a heart attack or anything life threating.

I should enjoy life but ik this is something that will take some time to deal with.

My hands shake a little and I still have a fast heart beat even when I don't feel panicky. It also feels like a pit in my stomach is waiting for a thought to pop up for me to panic.

I started Lithium in August and was able to help my husband at work within a month. I came out of my shell, began to make eye contact, conversation, and was hired on as an administrative assistant. My career was teaching, but I know I can not be that person anymore.

I like lamictal but it has a lot of sideffects so I’d like to get off of that too. I love my sleep med roserum. I got off of and had really bad withdrawal from lorazepam but it helps my major panic issues. So I’d keep that but use it sparingly.

My husband said he’d seriously consider divorcing me if I go off of my meds. I’m kind of devastated. We were together before I got diagnosed and medicated. We never had a bad relationship while I was off meds. I did some stupid shit occasionally but we got though it more easily than a lot of the shit I’ve done medicated. 

He drank like a fucking fish, got increasingly violent and acted like I shot him when I said I’d divorce him if he didn’t stop. He was sober 1 month. 1. And while infinitely better, still has episodes of drinking way too much. And I’m supposed to take it with a fucking smile.

But how fucking dare I say I want to get off the stuff that give me side effects I don’t want to live with anymore. I’m even open to other medication, just not what I’m on currently, except maybe lamictal.

797,"What should I do? Gaming Anxiety I'm currently playing a video game, but long story short, my question is: Although it's unreasonable and extremely unlikely I'm worried that my account is going to be deleted and it's a 100+ hour game. So, I can either just cut my losses (Only 5 hours in) and start a new account, giving in to the anxious thoughts and discomfort. Or keep going feeling bad playing this account I'm currently playing, but could maybe get over at some point? But my basic question is, to get over anxiety do I have to push through it when it's really hard? Or let my self off sometimes?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm had gaming anxiety for about a year and a half, it's really affecting my enjoyment with them, I always feel that my gameplay experience is  being tarnished in some way, example: Feeling that I'm wasting it feeling anxious, The game is going to bug out on me causing me to have to restart etc.

801,"Dissociation? I started a depressed episode in oct of 2022, this did not start right away but rather crept in especially in the last 2 or so months. I’ve been doing much better but this is still lingering, I feel as though it’s getting better but I’m not sure and just here to see if other experience this and if there are things to help. 

When I look in the mirror I do not recognize myself, I don’t even know what I think I look like in my head, it’s really hard for me to picture my face. But when I see myself I think this is not what I look like even tho it obviously is. This also happens when I look at photos of myself. It’s a bit bothersome and makes it hard to feel confident about the way I look bc I used to be so confident but now I don’t even know what I look like or am supposed to look like if that makes sense.",2

i’m now surrounded by lovely people but they’re all leaving the city for summer break. i can’t stop worrying that i’ll become depressed again. my plan for now is to take summer courses and pick up a campus job (e.g. working at the library). perhaps i’ll pick up a casual part-time job as well. i just want to make sure that i keep myself busy. last summer was tough cause i didn’t have the means to meet people and interact, and i’m hoping this time it’ll be different if i put myself out there. honestly though, i just can’t help but worry a lot. depression is my worst enemy and it lives inside me. at this point, i can’t let it fucking win again.

804,"The Root cause of my AVPD I have spent a lot of time thinking about how I ended up with this disorder. Constantly reviewing and analyzing my past memories, trying to find and pinpoint the exact event that caused me to be this way. I wasn't sure I had one, and I still think it may be multiple events in my life that led to the development of this disorder. But for me, I think the formation of my AVPD has always been interlinked with my sexuality. I am gay and Hispanic. Growing up in a Mexican household, parents are not accepting of that whatsoever. Anyways, I remember I still remember this time where I was looking up basically dick pics and I didn't delete the search history. I was 13 at the time and was barely discovering porn. My mom checked it before any of us got home and while she was at work later she called my dad and told him about what she found. My dad told me that she was crying because she couldn't accept that her son might be gay. I explained it away to my dad that I was just checking to see how I sized up to other boys my age. But I sorta knew what I was doing.  I guess that moment was pretty scary to me. Knowing not even my own parents would accept me. And so I hid myself, for a long time. Pretending to be straight year after year. It just got harder every year to put on the mask. And still now at the age of 24 I have never told anyone in my personal life that I'm gay. Not like they don't know it or highly suspect it, even though I present myself more masculine. I've never had a girlfriend so I think it's pretty obvious to everyone. But anyways I think it was very much so having to do with moments like I first mentioned. Where I was scared and felt completely alone. I guess it would have changed everything to have someone to tell me it's ok and that there's nothing wrong with me and that I'm loved just the same. But I didn't get that. I just learned from an early age that I was different and so I would be treated differently, unless I hid it.",3

842,"Being the crazy lady I’m 61 now and was diagnosed bipolar 1 at 28. It’s quite severe, I get psychotic and inhabit a whole alternate reality. Despite taking meds religiously all these years, and trying so many different combos, I still average one manic episode per year and they can go on for months. The consequences of the episodes have been serious, especially when younger. I haven’t been able to hold a job and am on disability. 

Unlike many of you that I see here I am often not able to ‘catch’ myself, and once it’s at a certain point I lose all insight and am belligerent if people try to suggest I’m not ok. Last year I seemed to have a good year and felt more hopeful and optimistic than for some time. But that came crashing down when I was suddenly arrested and dragged off to hospital in the New Year (I’d done nothing criminal but I guess I must’ve been acting strange). 

One of the hardest things for me is the shame and humiliation for how I acted when manic while being adamant that there was nothing wrong with me. In retrospect I could have been seriously harmed or worse when I used to roam around the streets at night and do risky things.

I could really use some help right now, cause I'm so lost.

I've been drinking and smoking so much for the past few weeks, its really starting to hurt me really bad. But, I think I just lost something special. So basically, I was in a relationship with this girl for around 4 months. We hit it off real good, right from the start. We used to hang around uni together, and it felt so perfect. I had to break it off with her, since I wasnt really looking for anything serious, and she insisted on only that. Ever since the beginning, and even during our relationship, she only prioritized friendship over us. It was always friends, friends, friends for her. We said we'd balance both, but somehow she didn't do anything much about us. She also had a lot of guy friends, that made me feel so bad about, but I never got the nerve to tell her about how that made me feel. Seeing her dancing with all those guys post breakup, sparked a different kinda anger in me. I know I ended this, but I was really hoping that we would atleast stay friends. I told her how much she meant to me, and even begged her to stay. 
I just ended up blocking her. Her birthday, is in a months time. Should I even bother wishing her?

So this week I'm going to be starting my period, I struggle with BP2 along with really bad mood swings and emotional dysregulation about a week before my period starts. I'm talking I go from perfectly fine to wanting to hurt myself and ruin my relationships.

I have no idea how it's going to go, but things are going really well with someone I'm interested in. But with my period starting soon I can already see and have already started freaking out because he was acting distant, he later told me he was spending time with a friend. That calmed me down because it explained the ""distance"", but I tend to over react while suffering with the mood swings, etc;. I don't want it to ruin how well things are going, but I can feel the paranoia setting in again.

923,"Anxiety and Weed Hi, looking for a bit of advice and experiences from r/anxiety here.

Around Christmas I started to develop some kind of anxiety disorder and had a lot of panic attacks. For most of my life I've always been a little anxious and tended to overthink, but these symptoms were just much worse. Up to this point I've also been smoking weed, but not excessively, mostly once a week. After developing said disorder, weed now increases my symptoms, despite it never doing something like this before and it mostly calming me down. Even when I had a greenout, I mainly suffered physical symptoms. 

In response to my symptoms I started with autogenic training, a lot of introspection about my fears and stopped smoking for about a month. With this I got the worst of it under control. Since then I've been smoking a few times with mixed results, sometimes I get more anxious and panicky, but on other occasions it also felt like a normal high. 

Right now I still have some lingering symptoms that can be better or worse, depending on the day, so I'll definitely quit weed until I can resolve this. My question now is, if any of you here have suffered something similar and were you eventually able to smoke without getting anxious again? I'll be honest, I quit enjoyed being high, so that would be quite the bummer, but certainly not the end of the world.

It's as if the words are all sprawled out in my head and whenever I make an attempt at talking, it just comes across as disorganized and incoherent. I'm not a leader. I can't direct. I'd rather follow than lead. 

Today was especially horrible because I'm generally a well organized person who has it together, but my classmate ended up seeing how much of a mess I am. After something fell out of my plan, I got flustered, shut down entirely. It's so embarrassing, and now I want to hide from everyone. I don't know how to recover from something like that, or show that I'm better than my anxiety.",4

936,"Paradoxical cycle of my past, present and future and suicidal ideation Hi guys , 

So I am a bipolar and I haven't actually told anyone but few about my bipolarity. Anyway I believe being a bipolar affects the way I am thinking and the decisions I make according to my emotions which are instable and which will eventually lead to a feeling of regret and guilt later.

So my problem is that now while the usual and frequent depressive episodes trigger, this depressive episode is the WORST so far, I live in this paradoxical loop and cycle between my past and all these nostalgic moments I am always recalling in my mind that could make me sometimes happy but also crying because I miss these moments so much and miss the people that I don't see anymore but have been a great part in my life nevertheless left me for either no reason or with a reason that I couldn't really do anything about it, my present which is affected negatively by my nostalgia and emotions for the past and taking a great amount of time just living in the memories, living in the past and dreams instead of living in the present time, and my future which l do think about but don't care about it anymore, sometimes I used to think about my future to forget about the past but failed to do so. 

Thinking about what I could do in the future makes me a bit happy nevertheless when these nostalgic moments hit me, it just converts me from a happy person to a sad, desperate and disappointed person again that eventually lead to deep depression which cause suicidal ideation, mostly to overdose to death, but ends up with failed attempts to commit suicide. I can't even determine if these memories are good or bad by now cuz it depends as well, sometimes I just get the good parts of the memories while other times I just get the tragic parts and events that happened to me as for getting bullied recently at the university, losing my best friend, losing my boyfriend ...etc. I just believe by now that good memories are even worse and more hurtful than the bad ones. It just feels like getting stabbed in the back.

These many emotions and mixed-up thoughts I get give me a headache and usually panic attacks, that sometimes I cut myself with a nearby sharp thing as well.

I also have ADHD, social phobia and severe trust issues. I now feel so bad that I wish this world to stop and my life ends. Thinking about suicide already makes me more comfortable to end my struggle you know. So I've been asking if I am alone on this. Does anyone relate to my experience?",2

940,"Tendency to shutdown I'm sure I'm not the only one doing this but I find myself shutting down and withdrawing from people and situations to such an extent that I am unable to look them in the eye. It is triggered through different mechanisms but most often than not it is triggered by a situation in which I feel less worthy than what I already am.

I have low self esteem and an extremely negative view of myself. Notwithstanding my past having an influence on that view. 

Some situations may come across as innocent; suppose you were friends with someone. Not direct friends, a friend of your significant other or a friend of a friend. This friend takes interest in you only at times where they are in your company. Or having a mental meltdown in my case. They never text. Truth be told, they never even ask about you.

Another example, people ask you your opinion about something. You give it thinking it may be of use but then it turns out they didn't even bother listening. Or they brag to you about a choice they made when you suggested it in the first place. 

You feel like nobody sees you. Nobody respects you. Nobody listens to you.

I withdraw and I shut down. Although I can try and look past it, I can never truly get over it. It adds to my negative outlook on life and it breaks me down further. Soon there'll be nothing left to break.

I feel alone; levels that's been elevating over the last couple of years. I don't know if life is truly worth pursuing anymore. Any way, don't mind me. Just another rant.",3

I am now 28. I also struggle with BPD, social anxiety and Avoidant Personality Disorder, afraid to leave the house by myself, reliant on my 66 year old mother to pay my medical insurance, and my husband is working full time barely keeping us afloat. I have tried and tried to work. Several different fields. Even part time. It always ended up in burn out and felt more depressed and anxious so I had to quit. I am worried, I feel my future is really hopeless. I love my husband so much. We wanted to have a family and it's feeling like that won't happen because of my mental health and the low money thing. I am afraid he will abandon me because of all this though deep down really don't feel like he will because he has been here through everything.

I know that is so much. That is definitely something to be grateful for. But we fight a good bit because we're both so stressed out.

Nothing really brings me happiness except substances, (and that leads to bad feelings when it wears off or sometimes when on them) and I've been mostly sober for a year.

I see a therapist. I take medications. I just... I am not content in life. I am constantly worried about everything. I constantly feel like I'm worthless and my husband deserves someone more stable that he doesn't essentially have to be a caregiver to at times. I stay in bed about 70% of my days because I feel like things are so hard to do and feel so pointless.

I don't have many friends and live in a small town, so there aren't any meetup groups or anything. And since I don't work and am not in school, no opportunities to make many friends. I do have one so I can try to branch out with her friends maybe. It feels like life is just about working. And I feel so depressed by the state of everything, and by my worries that things won't improve in the future.

Things don't get better. Not if you don't work for them. And I have worked, I've tried so many treatments, but the one thing I rarely do is go out in the world.

And Im better, actually. I'm feeling more calm around other people. 

But there is something that it's haunting me since I'm trying to better my anxiety. I realized that there are some people that makes me worse. Sometimes even colleagues.

And I'm always in the ""alert mode"" when I'm around them. I don't know if this is a problem that my anxiety creates in my mind or if it's something that other people also feels.

That's why i'm here. I'm trying to understand if the problem is me and my anxiety or them. Anyone feels like this around some people?

960,"this disorder has stopped me from pushing myself for the better me. Was scrolling on tiktok when I saw my previous school mate 2 years younger than me on my FYP. She's a famous race car driver representing our country all over the world. She now just recently joined an F1 school. I know money and her being a nepo baby (her father was also a race car driver before) helped her achieve big things, but she also wouldn't be where she is right now if she wasn't great. 

I just realized that I'm 2 years older than her and I'm about to repeat my last year of highschool (i dropped out this mid school year because of mental health reasons), and I still don't even know wtf I wanna do in life. 

My best friend is so fckin smart, she's studying right now to be a chemical engineer. My other best friend is also smart, all of his grade averages are 95+ (100 is the highest in my country). 

I'm surrounded by smart, and talented people with a future, people who will make a name for themselves and become rich in the future. People who have already carved their paths. While I'm here barely even making it through the day. I can't even go to school without wanting to off myself, while they're here working their ass off for their future.

My best friends don't even know I already dropped out of high school. I'm too embarrassed to tell them. How can I tell them? They would be too embarrassed to have a highschool dropout as a friend. What am i even doing with my life? I always avoid things, things that make me feel uncomfy or unsafe. Now look where that got me. Stuck inside the house wasting my life away.

961,"How to tell the difference between mental disorders and shit life syndrome? I've been trying to answer this question for a while. How do I know what's the cause and what's the effect when it comes to mental state? Am I depressed and suicidal because of how my life turned out to be or am I perceiving life to be more shitty than it is because of underlying mental disorders?  

I have never been to a psychiatrist so I have never been diagnosed, but I've been dealing with OCD since I was 6, I experience a lot of MDD, anxiety, social phobia and ADHD symptoms. I've also been suicidal for more than 6 years at this point. The thing is, most of those things appear so small when put next to 7 figures in the bank account. Most of my issues would immediately disappear. Only then I would be able to do things because I can, not because I have to. I experience what I'd call a ""money induced paralysis"". I talk a bit more explicitly about it in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/v4qq6k/discussion_lack_of_motivation_induced_by_lack_of/) thread.  

It's very unlikely that I'll ever be financially independent and it's unlikely I'll ever find something interesting enough I'd deem worth pursuing for hours on end(AKA passion). Those realizations alone are enough to make me apathetic, procrastinate on all matters and basically give up on life and wait for the right opportunity to kill myself. I'd rather be dead than live a life I don't consider to be worth the effort.  

I've been thinking about seeing a psychiatrist for the past few months but I have my doubts. I procrastinate on making an appointment because it feels like my problems stem from money, it's not like they'll make me rich over there. In fact I'll lose money. That is enough justification for me not to go. I also can't get myself to schedule other appointments (blood tests, physio, dentist) because if my life will remain the same despite improving in some areas, then why bother? I'll kill myself anyway without winning a lottery or without some magical epiphany occurring in my mind.  

I suspect there could be something wrong with my brain, because plenty of other people have lives objectively worse than me, yet they see survival as something of value in and of itself. That could be the result of them being ignorant, me being ungrateful or my brain being disabled. So, how do I know whether my shitty mental state is caused by my views on life, philosophy, bad attitude, being lazy, ungrateful, spoiled, etc. or by some condition beyond my reach? Or perhaps that's how it's supposed to be, because my conclusions are logical and I just can't ignore them?",4

being officially included in this consumer society, as a consumer, won't fix anything.
I couldn’t even enjoy my childhood, same with my teenage years.
How am I supposed to have the strength to at least have hope for adulthood? 
I’m too tired, this world is sick,
a huge amount of people in this planet talk about happiness as if it were more present than misery.
 I can't stand this hypocrisy anymore.

1000,"i'm being negligent at work i've been so negligent with everything in my life. my head feels full. i neglected applying for leave early enough and was called out in front of my entire team (indirectly. my name wasn't mentioned). i'm wondering why i did that?? why did i delay applying for simple leave? i feel so guilty and ashamed, but i also have the feeling that i'm beating myself up too much for it 

though, this isn't an isolated incident.

i was meant to deliver assets to another team but neglected to double-check if we had all the assets to deliver. instead, i ignored the issue. the team eventually called me out for it. ideally I should've flagged the issue and had them deal with it... but i was just too lazy?? it wasn't even a big deal. nothing arduous, but i got too lazy. what's worse is that I didn't own up to my mistake.

i feel soooo ashamed, wow. i don't know what's up. i'm slipping lately, in the most tiny, unnecessary ways but it's making me feel so anxious and disappointed in myself.

what is this?? self-sabotage? negligence? why am i failing in the most unnecessary of circumstances?",0
1001,"why does overthinking and worrying so much destroy our goals? I agree I'm overthinking and an introvert. But I just do that because I just want to be on the right track and not make mistakes and then later regret. I'm learning that overthinking and worrying so much just leads to more stress and it actually destroys our mindset to achieve the goals that we set. It just leads to more misery because we feel more lost and confused and overwhelmed.


I'm actually enrolled in community college but I keep doubting my major and everyone seems to be going for higher education and certification. Everyone seems to be going for big money and comfort but I guess it's more about having stability future and growth. I feel lost too like I don't know what to do.

I think about freshman and sophmore me and I don’t remember ever being this anxious. I think all the years of stress of engineering school have finally gotten to me. Between internships and summer classes, I haven’t gotten much of a break. Winter breaks do help, but I’ve noticed that the “recharged feeling” I have after has lasted less and less after each one. I know I’m almost to senior year and it’ll get easier, but I’m just really overwhelmed. I shouldn’t be feeling this stressed all the time. Having so much anxiety has made me feel down.

What would everyone around me think if I just randomly disappeared for a month or more? (I know I have bigger problems but Its of concern to me)

No access to cell phones or my job for that matter.

I just don't see how a married man with 2 kids and a fulltime job can just disappear and go off the grid. I have bills to pay and mouths to feed.

1006,"Exhausted/Tired all the time (in denial) So I am a 36 year old male. I have had depression on and off my entire life. More on than off, but my off periods were fantastic. I was capable of pure joy. Energy. Zest. I could be the person that lights up a room. Sorry to toot my own horn. I have always, however, had health anxiety. Worried about this and that, many medical tests, etc.

Over the last year, other than the 2 months I was on Zyprexa (which I guess should be very telling) I am exhausted beyond belief. I am crying all the time.  I almost never feel well-rested. I want to sleep all day. But even when I try to nap I rarely fall asleep. I just lie there and remain exhausted. Physically so exhausted. Last year I had a stupid pulmonologist (sometimes they dabble in ""sleep medicine)  suggest to me that I had narcolepsy. As a person with health anxiety, this was terrifying. I got 3-4 separate medical opinions, ALL of them from major Universities. They all said I didn't even close to have narcolepsy, and that It was my depression causing it. My tests (overnight sleep study and daytime nap study) weren't close.  I didn't believe them. I was in denial. **I think because I used to have times when I felt great and the depression lifted, this had to be something different.**

However, if I try to look at things objectively I have to see that in the last year, I have become a caretaker for my mother with ALS who is rapidly progressing, I have become more isolated and hang out with friends less, and haven't been working on my passion (music) as much. 

Has anyone else gone through *depression denial* and tried to find a medical explanation for their somatic symptoms (lethargy, exhaustion, brain fog, crying all the time) only to get every medical test in the book and have all doctors (and friends and family that know you best and love you) tell you its depression?

side note: I went for a run (while crying lol) yesterday for the first time in two years and it totally took away my brain fog. I still feel tired, but I feel clearer. That was new.",1
1008,"I hear people singing and music when I get manic? Does anyone else have this happen to them? It's very strange.

I remember maybe when I was 7 I would be confused as to if music was actually playing.

It doesn't happen too often, but it's peculiar when it does. I became more consciously aware of this when I was maybe 13. I remember being restless because I could hear music, but it was too clear for it to be real. I went outside my bed and didn't hear anything.

I was talking to my psychiatrist maybe 2 days ago about it. If you want you can take a quick scroll through my post history, but basically

1. Got sexually harassed badly from a supervisor. He told told me sexual things about my body and told me he liked sliding in and coming inside

2. When I reported it, the manager cut my hours to zero. I have to pay for rent and food, not to mention how it felt to muster up the courage to report it, and then right face retaliation. I've never experienced this kind of devastation before. I can't even describe how painful the act of retaliation in itself was. I was aware I might not be believed, but I didn't think I'd get punished.

So I told my psychiatrist about it and almost cried. I'm still processing this information, and I'm struggling. I really am.

Sometimes it's music playing. More often, actual music will be playing, and I hear an actual person singing along with the song, but they aren't. It's the most bizzare thing. I have to stare at their lips, and they won't be moving. But I hear their singing very clearly.

Has anything like this happened to others before?

But, thank God for meds. I've dipped in and out of suicidal fantasy because of it, but overall, it's been ok. I still have panic attacks when my throat closes up and I have to step away to cough it out and/or drink water. But again, thank God for meds.

I'm not going to ask for a higher dosage yet though. I think I'm stable if not for this happening.  Anyways, that's such a tangent. So I guess that's a question + rant I have for yall.",2

I'm not an English speaker. Recently, I moved to a country (non-English speaker either) for a job (that only uses English). Everyone I’ve dealt with has some international background with a good spoken English or is native.
It's my first international position and my first time living abroad. And I've never been so stressed with my spoken English.
Last week, twice during a meeting, my boss mentioned it in front of everyone. Everyone with such a diverse background compared to my mediocre one. Since this situation, my confidence has disappeared, and I have felt that my spoken English has worsened.
At the same time, I've been so paranoid about it, that I noticed some behaviors that worried me (like being fixed on only consuming English content, avoiding and culprit myself for even thinking in my native language).
I'm petrified. I feel I'm losing the respect of my colleagues...

_________________________________

Recently my therapist told me how mental health labels might help some but have a negative effect on some.

This discussion started when I requested a written diagnosis from her.

In my case after discussing labels with her, I was able to come to the conclusion that I tend to dehumanise myself because of the label.

I treat myself as “diseased” or “nuisance” and often feel bad for not being as good as “normal” people.

There’s a whole debate even in the mental health community about labels and how sometimes mental health professionals might misuse it.

So for now, I’ve stopped seeking out a diagnosis. But what about you? **Do you think the “AvPD” label helps you?**

But boy, if we just could stay longer above the waves. Inmidst that chaos there is still beauty in the sky, the stars, clouds and colors. I am sure that any one of us will be able to float for a minute in the future and enjoy the view. The chaos will likely still be there, but its not too big. Its just, yeah natural chaos itself. 

Chaos can be hard... who do i lie to.. it is fu*ckn hard. It is hell. But eventually, if we just listen to our bodies enough, everyone will get a level of calmness that wasnt there before. I truly believe that. 

I ran away too often. Too often i didn't want to feel that huge burning pile of hell. Everyday again i have to remind myself that looking at it will be better for me in the long term... which is of course even more stressful in the beginning. But i think - the only way to 'heal'.

I want to wish everyone out there a few seconds of calmness and soothing thoughts. That everyone will eventually be able to just float in the water look up in the sky and enjoy looking. Not worrying about getting enough air and fighting for ones life... We ve done that enough.

2nd time was last june 2022 was falling behind online class, thought i couldn’t get set up this program until teacher helped lol and i think this was the main cause of stress (fear of being unable to catch up? Lost?) also deep slow breathing didn’t work here. How to manage lmao

Most recent was few days ago, no leg shaking but just like the 2nd time can’t really think straight, brain wasn’t calming down even though i was breathing normally. Again it was a school related thing, had an IT issue i couldn’t fix, couldnt login to join lecture that was ongoing at the time. Feared missing out important content until i remembered i can watch the recording later but didn’t really get rid of that unpleasant rushed feeling and anxiousness that i need to get this login resolved. Only until i got connected with the school IT helpdesk that i felt completely fine again

1048,"I wish they made a film centred around an avoidant character I’ve struggled to find any kind of media where the protagonist specifically struggles with avoidance. I really enjoyed Amelie and resonated a lot with the character, but feel that she could more easily be seen as struggling with ASD, or even just extreme shyness/ introversion. 

I don’t know about anyone else, but seeing characters I identify with in films or in novels brings me a lot of comfort. It kind of brings awareness to those traits and humanises people, and has the ability to shift the audience’s perspective on those issues. Maybe if we had more coverage in the mainstream we wouldn’t feel as defective or alien.

I’d love seeing an avoidant main character and having people really understand how severe this disorder can be and how overlooked it is. It could be painful, and raw, showing how damaging isolation can be yet how there appears to be no alternative. But it could also have light moments, and laugh-out-loud moments, and show how people suffering with this disorder have light inside them despite everything. 

I also think it’s important that the character be shown to be relatively attractive, intelligent, good work ethic etc. I think a large part (and maybe the most tragic) of this PD is that we view ourselves as less than we are. Almost like we have conditioned ourselves to not value anything about us, even if that value is present. I think people should see how the issue is deep rooted, and it’s not as simple as improving things like wealth, appearance or even social skills. 

I’m curious what other people think would be important to include in a film centred on a character with AvPD

I became agoraphobic and couldn’t leave my house. I became obsessed with the news and the statistics. For someone who has been suicidal practically my whole life I was truly afraid of dying.

Did anyone else find yourself getting worse through this and what did you do to get past it? 

When I go to doctors appts they still make us wear masks and that scares me a bit still. Like what do they know that we don’t?

I’m sure I’m overthinking things like I do with everything else. My daughter is anti vaxx and it worries me too, I’ve had them all as a precaution since my health isn’t the best now.

I’m fairly certain I have avpd and have had so for the majority of my life. Like I have almost all of the symptoms down the the horrible childhood trauma that I experienced that started my downfall. Avpd is the only condition that I’ve been able to match up to down to a tee. I’ve went to therapy and discussed my issues, but it doesn’t seem like avpd is something I can ever officially get diagnosed with.

While I’m fairly certain I have avpd, my case is more mild because it doesn’t completely shut down my life. I would consider myself with high functioning avpd. Since I was young, I’ve always been lonely and had to figure out life out on my own since I didn’t have my parents or a loving family to grow up with. As a result, out of necessity I had to be financially independent and look after myself. Working and going to college was a never an issue for me. Because of that I’ve been able to give myself a good career and more or less have an ok life. My avpd is most severe in my personal daily life away from work. It’s a daily struggle for me. I also match all of the social symptoms of avpd and live a life of loneliness because I can’t get myself out to meet people regularly. Can anyone else relate?",3

I'd go to work, one of the parents would tell me what I needed to know and then went to work. When they got back in the evening we'd say ""goodnight"" and that was it. 

Since covid, however, at least one of the parents works from home. I currently work for a family with BOTH parents work from home. It's terrible. I jump at every noise that might mean they are coming to ""say hi"" to their kid. I worry so much about where they are, what they think they're hearing when I talk to their baby, my appearance, the way I dress. I imagine they're mocking the way I sneeze or they're disgusted by my weight gain.

I am very good at my job but my anxiety is so distracting it makes everything so much harder.

I get super overwhelmed and stressed out when my environment is messy, whether that’s clutter or dirty/grimey, so I try make the effort to take care of shared spaces so they don’t get to that point and stress me out.

Is it unreasonable to ask them to clean to a certain standard (nothing crazy but more than they’re doing now) if it is something that is clearly not bothering them?

The last manager that I asked for an accommodation basically insinuated that I was lying, and even when I proved it with a doctors note, she was still very rude about it, and acted like I was asking for something ridiculous other than needing to get up every two hours and walk around for five minutes because of my poor circulation. 

I have been let go in the past due to taking time off for medical conditions, but of course they don’t say that it’s because of medical condition they just say I’m taking “too much time off.” So I can’t claim ADA discrimination. 

I’ve been at my new job for a little over a year now and they are so flexible and have no issues with me taking time off but of course I built up this wall because of previous jobs and I’m always terrified to ask for time off when I need to go to a doctors appointment. 

My doctor is like “your health is more important than your job and you need to make this work so that you can do everything you need to do to handle your autoimmune diseases.” Obviously, my health is more important than a job but he doesn’t think about the fact that companies don’t give a shit about health and if I lose my job due to taking time off, I won’t be able to afford insurance or pay out-of-pocket for him. 

It stresses me the fuck out and I feel like each side is pulling me without considering the consequences.",0

I found one solution for this and I wanted to share this with you, maybe it will work for you too.

It is through listening to relaxing sounds in the background such as rain. We all know this sound and it is proven to have a calming effect on us. Here’s one channel I like, you might like it too.

1144,"I am having a extremely large amounts of anxiety for a person. I (17F) am in my senior year of high school. I’ve sort of always been anxious, especially about people. Any time ANYTHING happens to someone I care about, even a little bit, I get such bad anxiety that I am often unable to focus on other things. 

So, as I said, in high school. When I first started high school, life was a mess. What’s important to know is that I had just made a massive transition and had come out of the closet. Not a lot of support from family, but that’s okay.

In my particular HS, we have a home room class, and you have that teacher for home room for all 4 years. When I met my home room teacher, she was incredibly kind. For all 4 years, she continued to be this way. She made cards for everyone birthday, talked to me when I was rejected romantically for the first time, and always listened. We talked to each other while getting ready for the day nearly every day for the last two years. 

This week, she’s been absent. Very strange. Then, on Wednesday, she says in a slide prepared for the sub that she’s out on medical leave for the next few weeks. It wasn’t planned, you could tell from the way she talked in the slides of the previous days. 

I find out that she’s in the hospital, but fine. INSTANTLY, I’m full of anxiety, feeling like my soul was removed from my body. I’m just worried, like, a lot. I KNOW she’s fine, as far as everyone knows. I also led an effort for a “Get Well Soon” card, being given to her by another teacher she’s friends with. I don’t really know how to just patiently wait for the 3-4 weeks until she gets back. 

I’d also like to say that I KNOW she’s fine. My brain does not seem to feel the same way, especially when I’m not actively doing something distracting.

TL;DR my teacher is sick and in the hospital and I have a strangely large amount of anxiety, even though everyone says she’s fine.",4

My country has been ruled by religious extremists who are incredibly bigoted for eight years now- I'm so tired of their constant discriminatory comments, blatant disregard for any sort of decency and integrity and they overall just make me so tired and anxious and sad. They've started to rule when I was a teen, and I'm a young adult and they're still at the helm. It seems like they will win this year again, and another, even more extreme religious conservatist party has a chance at becoming the third biggest power.

1178,"I do not struggle only with the fear of being rejected but also the discomfort of rejecting I don't know if anyone else here feels like this, but I've noticed that the thought of having to reject someone I don't like is also feeding my avoidance.

At this point I already know that I'm not compatible with 99% of the people near me, I can't connect, I have some niche interests and different beliefs and values compared to most of the people where I live.
Finding someone I really like is something that happens one time in years and even though I know they exist, it is very rare for me to find them.

The thing is: sometimes people see me being more reclusive and think is just because I'm shy, I guess they feel pity/empathy for who they think I am so they start trying to socialize with me, but the truth is I am willingly distancing because I don't see anything in common with them or sometimes see things that actually annoy me, but I feel so uncomfortable rejecting their attempt, specially if we have to see each other a lot, even If I know nothing that satisfies me will come from there.

Because I have experienced the pain of rejection a lot of times I feel empathy for them (or, as I said, for what I think they will feel when rejected, which is the same pain I've felt in the past) but I also think there's also a factor of fear of judgement (and therefore rejection I guess?) here, because I'm afraid they will find me arrogant, rude, mean, superficial, someone with a superiority complex or just straight up be mad at me. I have this good girl syndrome and the thought of someone thinking bad of me is so excrutiating that just doing what is more comfortable for the others and not for me seems to be easier, but of course it's not being sustainable on the long run.

The past week has been literal hell where my muscles are constantly extremely aching. My legs have been so sore, I wake up every night from 2 AM to 5 AM with leg // stomach pain and anxiety attacks plus my guts have been churning and I’m constantly worrying about things. 

Has anyone else got these symptoms weird anxiety symptoms ? Sometimes I don’t even realise that I’m clenching my leg muscles they ache so much. 

Sorry for freaking out and posting about all of this. I’ll appreciate some good vibes / validation

Dear Journal, 
  I got sick again. The same cyclical vomiting and upper stomach pain I had before. Yesterday and last night was the lworst of it. I'm just now starting to feel slightly better. 
  My biggest regret is how quickly I wanted to end my life. This wasnt a little pain by any means. The  last time this happened, I had a psychotic break in the hospital and tried to cut myself open. This time wasn't as severe or long but still, the pain got so bad I wanted to end it all. I even thought of how. But by some stroke of fate, I talked myself out of it. Citing mostly that I just wasn't ready.
  I spent the rest of the night repeating that it will pass. All storms pass, this will too. I know it sounds silly,but either by distracting myself or blind luck, I started to feel better.
I've always believed you gotta do what you gotta do. Last night, I had to survive and I did. I dont know how or even why I managed to talk myself out of it, but I am grateful. I can't say I'll always have that power. It didn't even sound like words I would say. I mean ""this will pass"", how cliché. But as the night passed and dawn broke, I knew I made it. 

Just a reminder for anyone that needs it, you're not fighting alone. We can get thru this together 💜",1

For context they has DID and alters and I tried to accommodate for them as much as I could. Yet they randomly removed me after we spent a few weeks together (it was a visit) 
I don’t really know what went wrong as I took my meds and I have a passive nature in general. No manic outbursts or emotional ones at all.  We all were laughing and having a great time laughing and doing fun activities. But as soon as I got home one of them just didn’t want anything to do with me anymore. And I truly believe it was discriminatory behavior because I would bring up my diagnosis/ make jokes of because they would do the same. (Making jokes of my diagnosis helps me cope in a way) It took me bit to collect myself but I’m doing a whole lot better with therapy now that they’re not in my life anymore. They were also very against seeking medical advice for mental illness and rather get high and not address their issues with a professional. Has anyone else here ever lost close friends that backstabbed you over your diagnosis? Or is it better for people with this disease to just keep everyone at arms length and give the cold shoulder out of fear of discrimination or assumptions on what they think bipolar is?

I just wanted to say that if you need help there is something out there for you I used to be against antidepressants but they help so much it’s crazy i was happy and looked forward to the next day instead of waking up with dread I would literally go to bed early.

I used to make up excuses to not get the help I needed because if I’m being honest in was scared to be happy I was so used to being depressed I was scared of change but when you get on an antidepressant that mood lift makes you realize that change is what I needed and it was just my depression holding me back.",1

Every stutter, wrong word choice, thinking I said something mean or dumb, etc. It doesn’t matter if I did perfectly fine, I’ll find something to criticize. I tell myself I’m an idiot, that I’m inferior, that whoever I was talking to would be better off if I said nothing, or if I wasn’t alive.

I've made a little relaxation video, which might help you to find a little calm in the midst of chaos. 

It's actually based on Jacobson's progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) which is a scientifically based and easy-to-learn deep relaxation technique.  In the video we will briefly tense one muscle group after another, followed by a relaxation phase.  The interaction between physical and mental tension and thus relaxation is the focus and should help you find the relaxation you are looking for.

I hope it helps you :) All the best

I prefer to do my thing in the group, like at work, but I don't want to get mentally attached to anyone. I don't know if it's a survival mechanism to protect my own mental health or if it's just because I'm tired of trying to belong to somewhere.

I can’t believe I said those things to people, but it felt like the only way at the time.

Through a lot of reflection, I realized that I expected rejection and wanted to control it. I wanted to make them see me as a bad person, because I didn’t deserve them. But nothing in my life (that I understood at the time) was damaging enough to cause these problems. My family taught to me early on that if you’re not doing hard drugs or jumping off the bridge, it’s not a valid mental health condition. I didn’t think I had any reason to have the problems I did, so I had to give people ‘fake reasons’ to make them believe it, because my parents told me that’s the only way.

Also somewhat of a test, like if they stay for this horrible person I’m pretending to be, they’ll surely stick around for who I actually am if that’s better. And it’s not hard to be better than that, given the severity of the lies I told. If they leave, then I’ll have been in control of the rejection. And they’re not reacting to the ‘true me’ anyway so the judgement doesn’t hurt as badly. Avoiding the spotlight by pretending to be another person.",3

It’s so hard to watch. It’s like I’m looking in a mirror and just seeing myself 3 years ago when I was at the height of my illness.

He’s either ignoring me or can’t leave me alone, and I don’t blame that on him whatsoever. Every time he hurts my feelings rn I have to remind myself that 3 years ago I was the same way. 

It just sucks so much to watch someone you care about go through something like this knowing there is so little in support you can offer. Him and I are so desperate for him to see a psychiatrist and get stable, and are waiting anxiously for next week when it’s finally happening… but even then I know it takes a while for the meds to help.

Within about a year, I quit my job, lost my girlfriend even though she was great to me, and have yet to keep a stable job for more than a month at a time. 

My depression eventually was ruled to be “treatment resistant” after being on a number of meds and trying many other things. Some would work for a couple months and then I’d fall even further back from where I was. 

But now, after not having worked since early July of 2022, I am dealing with extensive and scary brain fog.

1. Pre-research the address: if the time is flexible, what times are the least busy (google maps is a good one to check). Is the destination open (check the website ahead of time).
2. Use Street View to check out the entire route.
3. Get your nav app all ready. I’ve found that Apple Maps (if you have this) is amazing because it will say things like don’t make right after this stoplight. Make a right at the next one. The destination is in the right, pull into the next driveway on your left, etc.
4. Leave with plenty of time to spare. Assume you will make a few wrong turns. Give yourself extra time to lose your way.
5. Research parking ahead of time. Use apps like Parking Hero. Use the city’s websites to find out the capacity of municipal parking ramps, if available. Scope out street parking with Google Street View, too.
6. Find alternatives to parallel parking. You can also park near driveways, so you can’t get parked in (easy pull in/out).
7. Dress comfortably so that if you get stressed, you won’t get super sweaty.
8. Make sure you have enough gas
9. Adjust your mirrors, clean windows, headlights for visibility, ahead of time
10. Listen to calming music/driving playlist 
11. Get toll money/EZ pass ready ahead of time",4

1259,"How to cope with shame Hello, 

I guess we all share this feeling of shame following us all around. I can't remember much of my life but I can remember almost every time I've felt shame. And I did it a lot of times. So much that even moments of my life that I had been SA are flashing in my mind all day. But other memories are just plain shame, shame of what I did in a specific moment, shame of how I reacted, what I've said, shame on how I was dressed, the way my face looked. What I recognise is that these are stupid reasons to feel shame, and I think anyone neurotypical wouldn't even think is such a big thing. I even felt shame and guilt of breaking things (because anything material has more value than me) . I legit had a panic attack once after dropping a water glass, I wanted to hold the broken glass and squeeze it with my hands until I made them disappear... I can remember most of the times I broke things. 

&amp;#x200B;

How do you cope with these feelings coming to your mind in your daily life?  When I remember one time, I start remembering the others, they are connected and so they come all together to me and make me feel that I will never delete those moments from existence, that they already happened, that there is no way I could live with those things that happened. I feel shame from myself all the time, but when those memories come to me I want to snap out of existence. I don't know how to deal with that. Thank you.",3

I got sad again and randomly searched ""avoidance"" on YouTube and one video that popped up was from this guy called Dr. K. I guess he's a popular mental health streamer on Twitch and a psychiatrist who works at Harvard.

I don't really play video games anymore, but I do think I have an internet addiction. Back in the day I definitely used video games as a crutch and it prevented me from being outside and meeting people, so I do relate to those who have gaming addiction + avoidance. A lot of the points he was making in his videos resonated with me. He talked about how a lot of gamers are actually fairly smart. Now part of this felt like he was blowing smoke up his audience's ass, but on the other hand, I can see a lot of introverted, smart, but shy types gravitating towards games. A lot of the people I knew growing up who gamed were pretty smart people, even the ""lazy"" ones who never amounted to anything in life.

Now, the part that I wanted to go over was the avoidance aspect of life. He mentioned how a lot of these gaming addicts are told they are smart and find school to be fairly easy early in their life, so they don't really struggle early in life, but later as they get older they lack the necessary abilities to succeed. Their self-conscious nature makes them wilt under the pressure of being judged. Anything that makes them appear as not intelligent immediately triggers avoidance. What a lot of these people don't understand is that they need to gain experience, not intelligence in order to succeed. 

I looked up Dr. K's history and it seems like he was struggling college student with a video game addiction and dropped out of school briefly to join some monastery in India. He came back and succeeded and went to medical school and became a psychiatrist. So I guess he's proof that fighting avoidance works.

But what do people who have wasted so much of their life and are already 30 able to do? He had the luxury of taking a dramatic step when he was 20 and able to come back and succeed. Not to mention that he is obviously capable of putting himself out there. Again, this could be due to ""experience"" and desensitizing himself, but how many of us would even be able to have the courage to pack our bags and go to a monetary. For someone like me, my mind is a confusing mess that a step like that would be met with a million different excuses to avoid doing that.

I don't have a healthy relationship with my family. I feel like my parents doesn't love/want me to he their child. Everyone keeps on leaving me. I don't have anyone to vent out. I don't have friends in school since I am an irregular student. The girl I love just ghosted me today. I don't have anybody right now. These past few days has been rough (all my life has been rough) and coz of that I've been always thinking of ending my life. All I have is myself. And I want to end my suffering. I've been dealing with this with all my life. I just celebrated my birthday last friday and it's the first time I celebrated my bday since I'm thinking that it's my last and I just wanna have fun, but during my bday, I lost my friends and I lost my girl.

All he wanted from me was some fuck hole. As I’d lay there and let him do what he wants and I’d sit and cry when I’d get home wondering if I should have let anything continue if I should have let him do this to me as he continues to use me for shit. I hope he actually kills himself before me so I can go spit on his grave and cry at the same time, because he is all I have left and he ignores me and complains that I fuck up so much and how I can’t do anything right. And I can’t do anything if I leave him he’s gonna attack me and most likely ruin my life. Even if it’s already fucked. He’s like a fucking man child he can bitch at me and treat me like shit but when it comes to me even slightly being upset because of his actions I’m the fucking bad guy. I’m the piece of shit.he is why I want to kill my self he is why I don’t want to find anyone to help me because he will get mad it’s not him. He will get pissed that I didn’t tell him I was going to kill myself while he has told me he wouldn’t care that I would die that I should do it and I will this week once I get the courage I need to say goodbye and not feel like shit as I die. I’m tired and sick of trying so fucking hard for him to treat me like garbage. I know I fucked up before I did a lot of bad things in this relationship but I apologized. I changed and I became new and now it hurts. Now I’m hurting myself when I said I wouldn’t now I’m shoving a pistol in my mouth with one bullet so he can’t hurt himself when I do it. Even in the middle of dying I’m thinking of him. Im thinking of how much I truly love and care even when he’s done this to me. Im still wondering if I’ll actually do it or after i actually end up pregnant or maybe during pregnancy?

1321,"Struggling to be in a relationship with depression I (24F) have been struggling with severe depression and anxiety over the past few years. The thing is I’m able to push through it all and put it on the back burner to interact in public settings. I’m funny, social and endearing with people who I’m not that intimately close with. Doing this I know it’s not how I genuinely feel but what people want me to be. I just can’t do it with people I love and are super close with. It feels fake and like I’m deceiving the people I love. 

That being said I met my bf and fell in love, the whole nine yards and we’ve been comfortably dating for over two years. I’ve grown to trust him and show him the parts of me that are slowly dying. Problem being I feel like the social persona I build is too fake for our relationship. 

I’m struggling to maintain my half of the relationship because of this. I’m so depressed/anxious all the time and I can’t bring myself to act and look happy. I’ve effectively gone hermit and can’t seem to navigate having a bf that I want around while I’m trying not to (ya know). 

I can fake it with everyone else I just don’t want to have that fake mess with him. I don’t know what do

I need your guidance for what to do with my life. 
I need someone to talk to. My life is a disappointment. 

I want to give back to my parents, what I am now is because of them. It hurts me seeing them getting old as time goes by.

 I haven't achieved anything in life. My thoughts are drowning me. Always too tired even without doing anything. Tired of life, only sleep is my therapy. 

My partner has her own problems, she's too busy with everything. My closest friends have left me. I dont want my parents to worry. My brother has his own family. I don't have anyone to confide to. Life is draining me to my core. 

Never felt so alone in my life. People are around me everyday but no one seems to care. I've been pretending to be okay for the longest time. I'm no longer my previous self, the confident one, the know it all, the positive guy. I have no ambition, no expectations, all I care now is how to finish the day. This has been my lowest state, my whole body is aching, my soul is hurting, my brain decided to stopped working. 

I miss myself. I miss being happy. I miss being at the moment. I miss celebrating life. I miss being intimate with someone. I miss competing. I miss my family. I miss my friends. I miss waking up excited. I miss caring. I miss eating with people. I miss being motivated. I miss having a purpose. I miss having a goal.

1350,"My physics class is wringing me out The more weeks go by, the more helpless I feel about this course. I hate the professor, I hate the lab partners, I hate the TAs, I hate the activities and homework we have to do and I hate physics the most.

I never had a sturdy foundation in physics anyways. The only reason i managed with physics in high school was because I memorized most of the solutions and most of the problems were similar to the other problems I practiced. Besides, my tutor was good at helping me learn. 

I'm doing an introductory physics course this semester, and I feel so absolutely dumb. We're supposed to work in groups to complete activities and every week we are given a set of problems for homework. The professor adds a set of puzzles at the end of every assignment to supposedly promote logical thinking and spatial reasoning or whatever.

The thing is I never really liked physics in the first place, but not I hate it. The labs are for two hours, I can't understand a single concept and the people in my group are so snide and rude about the fact that they understand the class and I can't. I remember asking for help about a homework problem to them on Discord, and I would have been grateful if they had given me a few hints about how they solved that problem, but all they did was send the wrong answers and made a bunch of memes about how they trolled me. One of the guys is so arrogant about how he took AP Physics and he knows all of the concepts and is so good at physics.

Meanwhile I can't even do a single problem independently. The professor also gives a bunch of puzzles like kenkens or spatial reasoning problems that I'm too dumb to do and I'm doing the worst in that class. It's just too much for me. 

Aside from that course, I'm in computer science and while my other classes aren't as awful, they're also pretty difficult. Plus, I have work study, and most of my work hours coincide with the office hours. I still have to take the course as a requirement and I feel like I'm going to fail.

But I often think about the people that went out there way to be nice to me, they would have got noting out of it, they did it just to be nice, maybe they could see I was shy and lonely and had pity for me so they would talk or smile or say good morning to me to make me feel like a human being even though people pitying me makes me feel embarrassed and small, I appreciate it so much but I’m never able to show it, so I just pray for them every day and hope they are having amazing lives and I hope they know they are angels.",3

When my body is under physical stress, or I’m under mental stress, I sometimes get the urge to hiccup. Not a series of hiccups, just one annoying outburst. And I guess I don’t really know if I’d call it a hiccup even. My parents have taken to calling it a “narg” because that’s basically the sound I make during a particularly strong one. Has anyone else ever experienced this before? And is it even really an involuntary stress reaction? It’s been happening for years. I even had an ultrasound on my gallbladder, since my doctors didn’t know what could be causing it. No issues there either. I’d love to hear if anyone has any similar situations.",0
1390,"there is no day when I don't want to die So, I can't anymore. I didn't think I would get here. I hope it won't be a long post. Thank you in advance.
F(26) I've always been the soul of the party, the kind of person you love to be around. Always joking, with super positive energy. Few people know what I'm like in my spare time, and that in fact there isn't a day when I don't wish to die.
If someone can understand that I feel alone since I was little. I have always sought to be seen, appreciated, respected.
My parents divorced when I was 5 years old. Since then, the relationship with my father has not been, because he is the most lying person I know. All my life he just promised me things and never kept his word. Now he has his family, which he does not take care of. Her children live with him, but they actually live like I did. My mother was always away in another country. He tried to compensate for the fact that all his life he ran after the perfect man and thus he neglected me. He never chose me. To want to move together to do something new 2. She chose men who, I'm sorry, did to her. And I had to grow up with my grandparents. With my grandfather always beating my grandmother. I saw all kinds of arguments, fights, scandals and everything that a child should not see. I always grew up with words like ""you're not good for anything, you don't know how to do anything, you're like my mom, you're like tactu"" My mother has 2 brothers, who are super narcissists. That they gave me a juice when I was younger ""they raised me"". Grandma raised the men of the family as if everything was theirs. And my mother and I always had to do everything. From food, cleaning, money... Everything. No, they are men and we are women. Ever since I was little, I used to fight with everyone, because I was always different. I don't consider that my purpose is to find a man, to have a child and that's...as my family wants. I always wanted more. Because of this, my jobs were not exactly easy either. I was a team leader at 19, and it still wasn't enough, although no one in the family did more than me...
My grandfather died 2 years ago, and since then the family fell apart even more. My mother left again to another country, after her boyfriend who is my age and treats her worse than anything.. and I stay at home with my grandmother, who is also mean.
I tried everything, to meditate, to go to a psychologist, to stop thinking about all the things. Anything...
I feel alone, abandoned. As everyone sees their life, I remain here behind, worthless, with nothing. I have nothing. Not a day goes by that I don't think I want to die... Thank you.",1
1391,Why is It hard to accept its just anxiety after numerous tests and reassurance. It’s been almost two years living trying to manage health anxiety and almost nothing that I try is working. I’ve been on anxiety medication for three months and thinking I was only gonna need It for 3 months I have actually increased the dose and want to be in It longer. I learn a lot in therapy but always fail to incorporate any technique in real life. No matter what I do to cope I just can’t shake the anxiety away. I know anxiety is a part of life and regardless it’s going to come up but I can’t stop catastrophizing the anxiety I feel. The anxiety makes It hard to focus in school and at work to the point where I’m close to leaving both. How do I get It through my head that I am okay. That anxiety is okay. That any tiny thing my body feels doesn’t mean I’m dying. How can I trust my body. How can I trust myself. How can I trust in the universe. How can I stop.,4

I cant sleep, extreme irritation/rage and horrible anxiety. How have you learned to tell the difference between how you actually truly feel, and when your being irrational?

1395,"Should I tell my therapist about this? I (20M) have for the past 2 months been seeing a CBT therapists after struggling with mental health and depression for the last 3 years. A point that irked me was that I never could pinpoint the cause of my mental deterioration, so I assumed that my condition was just a result of an accumalation of bad experiences and circumstances in my later life. I have one week of therapy left until i am given the choice to end/contine/intensify therapy, and Ive lately been disheartened by how little they have helped. Something I never discussed with my therapist was that I believe I was sexually assaulted at age 6 by my cousin (11F) back in my home country. As far as I know, no one knows beside me and her, and she seperated from the family a while back as her mother divorced. If they did know, they may have chosen to never tell me in the hope I was too young to remember the event. The memory is so hazy that at times I question if it ever occured. Even then, I like to think of it of had having no effect on my life, but recently the memory has been surfacing more. Ive never looked back on this memory and thought of it as trauma, I have no feelings for the memory at all. But can something that I regarded as so insignificant result in symptoms many years later, or am I merely grasping at any clue to the cause for my depression.

But when these emotions become intense or prolonged disturbing our thoughts and actions, it becomes anxiety. Then we need to take steps to overcome it.

When you let go of them, you can take solace in the fact they remain in a safe space, but no longer occupying headspace. I developed CocoonWeaver because of a dream I had. My dream was about an app that would be intuitive enough to release the many fleeting thoughts that occupy ones mind. Since then, it has been developed in to a working product, and improved with the help of kind feedback from various neurodivergent communities. I would love to take feedback from this community as well, if you have a moment to download the app and share your feedback I would be extremely grateful.

1424,"Stress Relief in Making Things So last year, I went to a diner with my gf and I had myself a cappuccino for the first time. I've never tasted anything so delicious and I made it a goal to learn how to go about making one. After Christmas, I got myself an espresso machine. It would be a few months before I used it (lack of space where I live) but I finally got it set up back in November. My first drink, well... I never used a steam wand before. I watched some YouTube videos, my second cup was EXACTLY like what I had at that diner. Now I make about 3 cups a week or so (usually to keep warm more than anything) and it's expanding to where I got a coffee grinder so I'm not restricted by grind. If I want whole beans, I can work with them now. If I'm unsure what grind the bag I have is, pour some in the grinder to make sure.

Was it expensive? Well, getting everything together was about $260. With all the payment apps out there, it's affordable. You can make tons of stuff too. Lattes, mochas, I'll make hot chocolate with this thing. And I love it. If I have guests, I always offer to make them something. I found zen in the process, satisfaction in these product, and a desire to expand on what I know. It really makes me feel better knowing I can make something that not only I can enjoy, but friends and family can as well.

My advice? Learn a craft that you enjoy. If you like painting or even coloring, there's plenty of resources. If you like writing, maybe get a voice recorder for story ideas that pop up and expand on that for a bit. If you like food, all kinds of classes out there. But all in all, make something for you first.",0

1432,"How the hell am I supposed to deal with the ADHD + AvPD combo? I am formally diagnosed with Avoidant Personality Disorder tendencies.  My therapist and general practitioner both believe that it's caused by/comorbid with inattentive ADHD, but there is no formal diagnosis for that yet.  I am taking adderall 15mg XR for it though, and it is the only thing that has ever helped me.

How the hell do I deal wit this hellish combination?  I've deconstructed and deconstructed, but the only point I can reach is that I understand why and when things are happening, and that they're irrational, but I can't change it.

I have a handful of fixations/hobbies/potential professions that I jump between, and I never know if I can trust myself to know what I want.  I feel like I'm at an urgent crossroads in deciding what to do with my life, and I'm unable to stick to one idea.  Is it ADHD distracting me with a new shiny thing?  Is it AvPD ghosting my previous interest due to perceived failure/invalidation?  Is it both working in tandem?  I envy people who can dedicate hours a day to a single thing for upwards of a year.  Video game speedrunners come to mind specifically.  That's not something I am interested in, but I am beyond jealous of the ability to sit and do one single thing for ludicrous amounts of time, and perfect it.

My wife left me suddenly and with no warning after 15 years of marriage. I'm still in love with her despite her cheating on me twice. I blamed myself, but it doesn't change anything. She also left me with both of our kids, who I love a lot, they're 10 and 15. We've decided to slow date again, and see if we can actually be together, but she's already saying it's hopeless before the first date. Yeah, I know, it's a really bad sign, but I have to try for me.

I wandered around the house (I work from home) after work and just felt melancholic and went into each of the rooms and thought about memories in that room.

I'm a teacher and haven't been able to go to work for over two weeks now because the job is just too stressful and I can't deal. I've been seeking treatment for depression for years now with my bipolar ii diagnoses happening last September. No treatments have worked for me. All of them have made me feel even worse than before with short periods of respite in between. It's exhausting. I'm going on medical leave which means I won't be able to afford my own place anymore and have to move back in with my parents who thankfully have been very supportive but it still just sucks so much. I'm 33 and it feels like my life is going backward after working so hard to get just this far. One of my best friends who used to be extremely supportive of me just doesn't seem to care that much anymore about me and I've been dealing with that for months now. It's heartbreaking. I have other friends I can rely on but she was very special to me. I'm still learning how to move on from it but I just can't. I'm sick of waking up every morning feeling like shit.

the last days after i got officially diagnosed with anxiety disorder i went without any symptoms (i guess finaly having a name for my problems calmed me down).

But two hours ago when i came back from a walk my left back side under the rib started to hurt :/

It not a stinging pain or something that i can't manage, but it feels a little bit like back pain and is slightly pulsating i think??

It also radiates a little bit to the right side and i am feeling a bit dizzy/out of myself right now :(

I went to pee and it came out like normal without any pain, so It shouldn't be my kidneys right?

Fear and anxiety rule his every thought , loneliness and despair fill every breath in his lungs. 

Darkness reigns unchallenged, the light is all gone. Feelings of happiness extinguished and drowned, deluge of pain and suffering watered them down. 

Like an ancient warrior facing certain death, wounded , bruised and bleeding he marches on. 

Flashes of memories that are long gone, hints of an era that once had begun. With fire and passion his heart once fought. Stabbed and damaged it won’t pump blood , only anger rage flow thru the holes. 

For his Queen he swore once that death he would take. Just to protect her from the evils out there. But no one had warned him of the evil within. A festering wound that ends in gangrene . Rotting soul and heart but not too fast. Ensuring he suffers as much as he can.

The dream of a life was just a mirage . Leading the warrior into an inescapable trap. Battle after battle, war after war. Trenches of anguish is where he stands. 

What was the purpose the man thought to himself. Looking around for someone to help. No one in sight to hear his plight, only more darkness and none of the light. 

Hopeless and tired he kneels on his sword. With honor and valor he lets it all go. Plunging the steel makes the flesh cold. Followed by warmth of the pouring hot blood.  

Seconds feel like years as life flashes by. He enjoys every memory with his last ever smile. 

But out of the darkness someone reached out . Returning the light and the life that ran out. 

The warrior perplexed looked almost scared , for he had never encountered no one that cared. 

His story unfinished and with no clear path. But now he’s determined to let go of the past. 

Wounds that are healing wounds that will come. Master the pain that will never be gone.

No matter how close or how far. He will continue to battle this war.",1

I've done things in the relationship during manic episodes that I am not proud of. I've sought sexual relationships (mainly sexting) with others, been emotionally abusive, and quite manipulative. This was primarily during times before I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 and on a solid medication/therapy regiment. Now, I feel like I am the partner they need.

Howerve, and here's the rub, I have a sinking suspicion she is not the partner I need. She isn't supportive anymore and is somewhat condescending. She is constantly reminding me of all the past pain I have caused, and when I bring up that it was in the past she just says that I am not taking responsibility for that pain. Recently, she has gone so far as to comment on my appearance, calling my beard pubes and asking me to shave so she can find me attractive again. She brags to others that she got me to shave and belittles me in front of friends. She fights with me anytime I bring up a change that I wish to see in the relationship. She has commented on my weight. SHe has commented on my ability to be a father. She has accused me of having inappropriate emotional relationships with friends. 

I am honestly not sure if deserve this. I did emotionally cheat on her. I have verbally accosted her. I have been mean, aggressive, and manipulative in my own. These actions are mainly when I am manic and being confronted. I become incredibly defensive, to the point that I will be this way.

I know the relationship sick and that we need to speak with a couples counselor, but I am afraid that my partner will just listen and not change. Now, she used to be quite supportive.

1490,"I can't see the light anymore. Hey Reddit,

This is my first post so bare with me - but I'm lost and I can no longer see the light in life. I've been working a crap job for the past two and a half years where I've been overworked. On top of that, my team is beyond toxic and our VP has caused so many issues to the point half of the team left, and the ones who remain are hanging on a thread to the point some are going on stress leave.

I feel stuck. I'm dealing with issues personally, at home, and at work. 

I keep applying to jobs but nothing comes out of it. I've done so many interviews and made it through to the final round only to be told I was a strong candidate but they went ahead with someone else.

I feel lost and hopeless. I battled so much in my life and got through severe depression in my teens to early twenties and what kept pushing me then was the fact that I thought I'd create something out of myself. I thought my future would be better. But it's not. 

The days are getting harder and I'm not sure what to do or where to go or who to turn to. I feel heavy all the time. I'm a 28 year old loser who has a stagnant career and a toxic job, no relationships, nothing. I'm losing hope",0
1491,"antipsychotics seem like a bit much been depressed for a while, had first ""manic"" episode a few months ago but doesn't seem that intense compared to other people's here. I was on an SNRI at the time that my psychiatrist stopped.

now I'm in full depression again, but he wants to put me on antipsychotics and I feel like that's a lot/dont wanna do it especially considering the side effects!!

but SNRI's are off limits because of triggering the mania, SSRIs and Wellbutrin haven't worked, I'm on lamictal and that hasn't worked, kind of running out of options.

I'd rather go unmedicated than doing the antipsychotics (Abilify in this case). I don't feel like I'm ""psychotic,"" even in my mania it was barely psychotic--feeling like I could feel objects emotions. 

I started crying in the psychiatry office because I feel so bad about myself that nothing works for me and also that I might have to take some drug that leads to decreased brain volume and weight gain, hair loss, dementia, Parkinson's, etc.

So: at what point do antipsychotics actually become necessary??

1496,Dismissive psychiatrist Started latuda awhile ago and I just had my follow up appointment. My memory recall and all around cognitive abilities have declined significantly. I have anxiety and fears that I've never experienced. (Fear of death etc). You know what my psych told me? These aren't things common with latuda. He told me that I need to get tested for obstructive sleep apnea. All of my symptoms point towards that instead of mental illness. What the hell!

1497,"Quality over quantity - Friendships I know people with AvPD struggle to maintain friendships and I do too. 

For me, I think it's the daily (or at least frequent) messaging to stay in touch that I struggle with. I will get tired and ignore messages just because I don't have the capacity to engage with a subject that I frankly probably don't care much about or I'm just worn out by the constant interaction. The messaging for the sake of messaging gets to me. 

if it's a friend that lived far away then I'd rather not speak for 6 months and then just meet up and have a good time before reverting back to usual which for me is far less exhausting and  fortunately I do have a couple that are like that.

1509,"I've missed about 3 weeks of class and I'm too embarrassed to go back-what do I do? Hi, I've recently started medication to help manage my anxiety. While adjusting to the medication, I noticed it helped my society anxiety a lot because I stopped caring. However, the downside is that I started to become very apathetic about everything and lost a lot of motivation to even get out bed/go to class. 

I've recently started a new medication and so far feelings of apathy/lack of productivity have improved, and I can now finish tasks (still not perfect, but I feel like with such a low starting dose it feels back to like how I've felt pre-medication.) The problem is, my social anxiety has gone back up. I'm ashamed and embarrassed to have missed so much class. I tried really hard this week and forced myself to go to classes I've been avoiding, but there is one class that I'm especially having a hard time getting myself to attend. The problem is, the class is very discussion based and we have predetermined groups we work with the entire semester. I'm worried my groupmates will judge me because I haven't been to class in so long, I just want to avoid the awkward confrontation ""Where have you been?"" even though I know it's inevitable. How do I force myself to go to class?",4

The thing is that at 25 my recently diagnosed avpd has destroyed me.  Even though,  I have a career ,I'm financially stable and got to organize my life a bit. I don't have quality of life. I'm so anxious I can't even function worried about what the neighbors around my apartment might think of me. I still leave the house for going to work  but sometimes I'm so freaking exhausted I cannot take care of myself.  And I can't stop but wonder if becoming a parent would be a good idea for me or if it will be better to forget about it as I seem to be a person who doesn't fit into the scheme of a good parent.

However, I get symptoms if I don’t take the quetiapine at the same time each night, so I had to take it in the morning because I started getting symptoms. Basically I don’t think I can even get to class right now because I’m so out of it, normally I sleep after taking it so I forgot how crazy the side effects can be especially because I haven’t have food in awhile.

This past year is the first time I've had a very unhealthy relationship with food (had my second child and have been nursing her. I'm a sahm with a 3 and 1 year old). All I can think about is food and eating. I'm constantly ""snacking"" and I'm always eating really bad and unhealthy options. I sometimes get healthier options but something in my brain just won't go for those in the moment and I truly feel I can't control it(I know I can and should be able to but I guess my willpower sucks). I'm so sick of starting and restarting  my health journey every day because I can't keep from overeating to an insane level. It's truly becoming embarrassing and I have so much shame.

I also have issues with hair pulling. I'll sit and pull my hair out one strand at a time anytime I'm idle. I'm well into it before I even realize how long I've done it. I've had this issue on and off since college. 

I've spoken about both of these issues with my therapist this past week and all she really told me was to find a sort of ""fidget"" to use when I'm idle to keep from the hair pulling. She gave me no advice on my food issues so I hoping to continue pushing that at the next session. Any advice or help would be so much appreciated, especially if anyone has experienced the same issues.",0

So my question to you all is what is the silliest purchases you've made when manic or hypomanic?

For example: I bought a pretty black sparkly violin on Amazon (It was on sale!). I don't play violin. I've never played violin.

Or one time I went to Petco to look at fish. I left with a parakeet, bird cage, and all the fixins... We had three cats, all of them mousers. They would have murked that bird. It was returned the same day.

1528,"Trying to wrap my head around all of this, hear me out if you will :) So I'm 50 M diagnosed (adult) with high functioning autism. I have been lurking the schizoid community for some time because I have so much in common with the guys who post over there. Mostly, it's the anhedonia that really strikes a chord with me.

The prevailing attitude over at r/schizoid seems to be this cavalier stance that loneliness is just a preference. Well, I take issue with this. Myself, I've been isolating on and off so much since even before puberty. Sure, it kind of feels good to not have to spend cognitive energy on social stuff. But loneliness is taking a toll on me. My brain operates on ""use it or lose it"", and I feel that now more than ever. Especially since covid-19.

The more I isolate, which is something I can do day to day without sacrificing too much in the short run, the less high functioning I become. I guess I substitute beer, vidyas and parasocially engaging on YouTube for the real thing. It's kind of working, but I really miss intimacy and that human connection.

1568,"My wife is pushing me away We, both female, have been together for 9 years and married for 3. During the course of our relationship, she has had periods of non diagnosed depression. Well she did go to the doctors maybe 7 years ago and got a few counselling sessions but never went back. She can be fine for over a year and then something switches in her and she just shuts off. This recent episode has been since last Tuesday and she is pushing me away. We have a day off planned tomorrow and she is telling me to go into work. She sits up on her own drinking and listening to music.  She says things have changed between us yet only a few weeks ago we were immensely happy and texting each other how much we love each other.  Yet she is saying we don't do anything and sit in silence. I know this isn't true. We go on lots of walks together, we stayed overnight in a hotel and had a theatre trip at the beginning of the month. I have been away with work for a few days and had a holiday with friends this month too.
She usually loves to make plans but is showing no interest in anything.  She also is quite on top with the house and is not really doing anything other than getting by.

She has issues with her mum (who has treated her appallingly throughout her life) and they are currently not speaking and she lost a close family member 6 months ago so I know things are getting on top of her.

I'm petrified that she is going to end the relationship but I am trying to hide this and stay my usual upbeat self. I've told her I'll stick by her in whatever she needs.  She won't see a doctor or consider a therapist and I just don't know what to do.  She isn't very good at vocalising her emotions and just says she wishes she could have a break from her life for a month.

I suppose I'm looking for answers from people who have felt like this or had partners similar to this so I can figure out if she is just falling out of love with me or is this depression and we will recover.

Personality is defined as the collection of behavior, attitude, and ways of expressing emotions that makes a person unique. We can identify if a person is with a good personality or not based on the outer expression of inner feelings. If you want to become a better and successful person in life, be it professional or personal, building up on personality is a good place to start.

1588,"Bipolar doubt I was diagnosed with Bipolar last May after trying to kill myself and did seven nights in a pysc ward which did me so much good.

For awhile before my diagnosis I had talked to my doc about ADHD cause I felt I fitted the symptoms of that so was in shock when I was eventually diagnosed with Bipolar.  When on what I call highs I get extremely productive.  I get so much done and take up new hobbies that never last more than a couple of months.  My lows are never so bad I'm depressed, but I have no energy mentally or physically and no interest in doing anything and I fall behind on everything.  The house gets messy and I struggle to achieve anything.

I have 3 kids so my anxiety goes through the roof when things get messy.  I'm snappy to be around for my wife and my mother and I get into moods because everything in the house is messy again.  It's like a vicious circle.  My lows causes me to let the place get untidy and the mess causes me to spiral into worse moods.

But sometimes when I read what other people go through and mine doesn't seem so bad in comparison I start to doubt I even have Bipolar.  These thoughts sneak into my head, I feel like an imposter and that I'm not really as bad as I think, and I'm only lazy, subconsciously tricking people and cheating by being on illness benefit.

Are these thoughts normal?  I feel so guilty with myself then and it makes my anxiety even worse?",2

I'm doing everything in my power to treat it: dermatologist, prescription acne cream, antibiotics, clean bedding, clean diet, daily showers, face wash etc. It just seems to get worse every day and it is some of the worst I've seen. I'm talking big red cysts. At this point I'm convinced my lithium is causing it.

I was making decent progress too. I was going to groups and started volunteering to get out of my house and around people again. I'm trying to work up to going back to work. But I just can't bring myself to keep volunteering looking like this. If I go out of my comfort zone while constantly concerned about how I look and feeling gross I feel as though I'm doomed to fail. If my mental state begins to slip it triggers my hyperhidrosis and then I pretty much have to bail. 

I'm kind of just stuck in a period of regression after making some strides. I don't know what to do it just feels hopeless.

 Reading some stories shared here I started to wonder what 'stable' mean for each individual and   how often do you feel stable but you think ""Am I really?"" 

I think every person with bipolar eventually will ask questions about what is part of their personality and what is the disease for lack of better word and I often think about the past and wonder ""was it that truly myself? how bad I felt, how good, when I was depressed, when I felt awesome and thought I could have accomplished big things, when I felt that I didnt fit anywhere and nothing was worthing pursuing...  thelist goes on

1613,"Now I am afraid of getting out of this darkness I am 20 years old, and a university student in South Korea.

When I was in high school, I was betrayed by friends who I really trusted. I experienced that one of my closest friends got bullied and quit school. I was so afraid, and I tried to befriend students in other classrooms. Therefore, they were my best friends. 

During the field trip, they said that they disliked me and asked me to leave. I was so shocked. I tried to talk with the teacher, but it was meaningless. After that, I was alone, and I spent days in fear. A week later, I was diagnosed with severe depression. I really had tough times. As I tried to commit suicide, I was hospitalized for 2 months.

I believed that the only way to change this situation is going to university. I studied hard and others said my achievement is a miracle.  However, my time stopped in high school. My heart and the way how to treat others are the same as a high school student like the days, I spent the whole night crying. I am good at making good relationships with professors. I treat them politely and as people who I have to learn. Meanwhile, I am not good with friends, because I am so afraid and don't know how to make a good relationship. 

Have you seen 'The Glory'? They said victims were abandoned at times they suffered. I totally understand what they meant. 

Fortunately, my medication is almost over. The psychiatrist will not prescribe antidepressants soon. That's what I dreamed and wished for. However, I am so afraid, because “I am cured” doesn't mean “my past is recovered”.

3 weeks ago I switched to a different SSRI and I started having symptoms like anxiety, panic, ruminating over that experience and feeling worthless which I think were withdrawal symptoms from the old drug (lexapro) 

I noticed that these symptoms come when there is something wrong with the medication or I am going through a stressful time.

I got a panic attack at work and my manager noticed and when I asked for some time off to recover they stalled and then they released an exit visa from the country and told me I would work remotely from my home country but there is no guarantee that they would keep their word. 

So now I am faced with the possibility of going back to my country which is going through a tough time economically and uncertainty about finding a new job. 

I am now back to the old drug I used to take and increased the dosage to 30mg with the Dr's supervision. 

I am not sure if the medication is not working yet or that I am going through a challenging time so I am having anxiety. 

I spend most of the time alone in my hotel room thinking of the past and worrying about the future and I am just exhausted.

1626,"Sleeping 6 hours, heart Racing and chest pain Hello all.

I have been on sick leave from work for 3 months now. 
Tomorrow I’m starting slowly again. 3 hours. 

Throughout all January I have had this persistent restlessness. I have been sleeping 4-6 hours every night, woken up, and slept again for 2-4 hours. Getting up at noon. The past two weeks I have tried to get up at 8, to match my work schedule. Now I only sleep 6 hours and stay in bed trying to get in the last two hours. 
It worries me that I’m still not sleeping through a full night.
I’m not sure if it’s stress or my hiatal hernia or my chronic neck pain that wakes me up. But I wake up rather abruptly. So I’m guessing stress. Sometimes I wake up with racing heart.

Speaking of racing heart - I started to get that randomly racing heart throughout the day. I wonder if it’s because I’m starting work and I’m nervous about it. I have social anxiety and I’m trying to fit into this new “me first” mindset. I’m a big people pleaser, but I have had to break with that habit now. Also I keep getting chest pain, I’m not sure if it’s my hiatal hernia or if it’s stress.

Idk what to do. I’m feeling uneasy about not feeling better than I am after 3 months.",0
1627,Temporary solutions to numb this until I can get proper care? How do you get through the day like this I have a great job and a potential promotion happening very soon but everything else outside my career is so sad right now. The only reason I’m still hanging on is because I don’t want another failed attempt and to look like an assshole or lose my job. My relationship is basically over my grandfather is dying in hospice with bone cancer and I’m slowly feeling like I’m spiraling even worse than before. I have to hide it from everyone in my life because everyone has something else more important going on. I really need to get to a psych and a therapist but scheduling feels impossible where I am located. I feel like I need immediate help but I have no way to get that. Even if I could I wouldn’t be able to get myself there because I can’t afford a car and my credit sucks. Are there any temporary solutions to numb the pain until I can get myself help that will not continue to hurt everyone around me or cause for alarm? What do you do to get through the days?,1
1628,"Therapy Success for AVPD? Anyone? I’ve only recently discovered my disorder falls into AVPD (6 of 7 characteristics). I’ve been going to a psychiatrist for years - who’s treated me for depression (Zoloft).  Ive always been “shy”, overly self critical, etc. 

I’ve been to 5 Therapists over the last 20 years - none have really helped me.  We’ve identified the causes of my AVPD (very critical parents, physical abuse. . Sexual abuse in Jr High.) However - that’s a far as I get. The rest is just talking about my feelings.  I get 6 to 9 mos in - and I feel like I’m just saying the same stuff. So I quit. 

Has any AVPD-sufferers ever had success with Therapy?  

What does “success” look like?  I can’t even imagine. Are you more socially successful and “bulletproof” from criticism?  

What methods did you use in Therapy that made you successful?  What did you do, beyond talking about your traumas, that helped you?

What kind of Therapist was helpful in getting passed, or improving?  Is there some specialization or kind of therapist that is more successful with AVPD?  

Thx.",3
1629,"Health anxiety - germs worry Tonight I met with a friend that I haven’t seen in a long time. We had a great time, had a few beers and chatted loads. 

We then decided to have a cigarette. Yes I know it’s bad but it’s been a while since we had one and we were having a good time so went ahead with it. I accidentally dropped mine on the street and proceeded to pick it up and smoked it anyway. It’s probably a few seconds after dropping and the pavement is on a relatively quiet area but still in a public areas. 

I didn’t think much of it but after a few hours I’m sitting here worried. I am afraid that I might’ve caught something from smoking the cigarette dropped on the pavement. I’ve always been a bit germaphobe so this is making my thoughts worse. I can’t sleep …

Yet today something simple triggered me. Someone I joined the company with got married, yet I was not invited (but few others were). This is not the first time this has happened. I can count on one hand how many times someone invited me and not as a second thought. Also the embarrassment when I only learned someone's wedding is coming when having a random group lunch, and learning I was not invited yet trying to sidestep other's question if I'm coming. I always think they have a separate group chat with majority of them, and always wondering why I'm not included. Maybe I'm too boring and not pretty/fashionable like them.

I've long come to terms with the fact that people are just not interested in me since I was a teenager. Always not being invited, being left out of information, or plain rejected to my face. I never have a romantic relationship, and no guys ever show interest in me. All the vague 'friends' term I use whenever I talk to my mother to hide the fact that her daughter was all alone ever since she entered university.

1655,"GoodRx vs. insurance I’ve been using GoodRx for some time now, and I’m so glad I found it. Some of my meds cost hundreds of dollars, with an insurance discount of 60% — but under $10 with GoodRx. Back when I took Seroquel, the out-of-pocket rate was about $700, with insurance $280, and with GoodRx $20. 

Medication costs have absolutely gone through the roof, even with employer plans. But for meds that offer generic, the cost is ridiculously less expensive with the app!

Mom’s oncologist prescribed her an anti-nausea medication, and I texted him to ask if there was a less expensive option considering CVS wanted to charge me $220 for a month’s supply. He was livid! He said CVS had been charging the old-brand name price for the generic for not only that med, but several others that his patients had informed him of. He advised me to download the GoodRx app, and I paid $10.

Just sharing as an FYI, as I’m on multiple meds that I used to pay way more than I should have been previously!! All mine are under $20, and only one is over $10. I’d be paying close to $1,000/month otherwise!",2

all I do is cry myself to sleep, stress eat and procrastinate. like that's literally my cycle of life.

1681,"I confronted my kid's teacher today My kid has been having issues with this teacher all year. They really struggle with concentration and memory and the teacher has been terribly unsupportive. It's the only class my kid has been failing.

A few months ago my kid was diagnosed with cancer. We set up a 504 to reduce the amount of assignments and give them extended time.

They were then out of school for two weeks for surgery. All of their teachers except the problem teacher followed the 504 and greatly reduced the amount of their makeup assignments.

Regardless, my kid worked hard to turn in a large portion of the assignments. Yet, they're still failing that class.

I emailed the teacher today to make sure she graded all the assignments. She told me she did, but otherwise did not give me any helpful information in getting my child's grade up. I then asked if she has been following the 504 plan and I've not received a response.

I've already been second guessing whether I was too aggressive in my emails, but at the same time I feel like I'm going to have to escalate it with the school.

I'm stressed and I've been fucking sick to my stomach all day. I'm cycling between anger and embarrassment and I'm going nuts.

Just needed to vent 😞

Edited: Thank you everyone for your encouragement. I've been in continued correspondence with the teacher. She stated that she has already reduced the amount of work, but I still have issue with the amount and content.

I also elaborated on the fact that my child has been having issues all year only in this class. My child has told me they're afraid of this teacher and they struggle with her teaching methods. The teacher had no helpful comments, and has only repeated that ""the issue is missing assignments"" as if I don't have eyes. She also said she thinks they can turn this semester around if ""we"" can motivate them, and thinks they are not having academic difficulties. This rubs me the wrong way because motivation starts in the classroom and she's clearly been lacking.

1682,"Insecure in relationship - TW: suicide I had a serious suicide attempt a few days ago where my bf had to call an ambulance and I was in the ICU for a couple of days. My bf had already been through one (minor) attempt with me 6 months ago. He was really upset this time and told me that if I have another attempt he won’t be sticking around, it has to stop, it’s too much for him. He also said I can’t self harm anymore or the relationship will be done. We’ve talked about getting engaged before, and he says he will need to see me 100% clean for a while before considering marriage now as he doesn’t want to have to get a divorce if I relapse—he is full on serious about this ultimatum.

I’ve never felt insecure in our relationship until now. I feel threatened, I can’t guarantee that I won’t have another attempt or self harm relapse for the rest of my life. He is the sweetest, most supportive, loving and caring bf I have ever had and I want spend the rest of my life with him, but now I feel like it’s inevitable that I will lose him. I feel heartbroken already. I’m scared of losing my person.

(although I didn't really have many friends but it still hurt) Because my mother didn't want anyone to know we were moving I just had to vanish. After losing friends, and not having a stable environment I think I pretty much gave up and have been a homebody/shut-in ever since.

1688,"Crazy how powerful thought diaries &amp; breathing techniques have been for my anxiety  I've been undergoing therapy for anxiety and depression for the past two months. My therapist recommended that I start keeping a ""thought diary"" to write down any worries or concerns that I may have and to practice a breathing technique that involves breathing in for four seconds, holding for two, and then exhaling for four seconds.

Initially, I was skeptical that these simple practices could make a difference in something that has troubled me for years. However, I began to notice that whenever I started to become consumed by anxious or depressive thoughts, jotting them down in my diary helped me immensely. This process allowed me to break down those thoughts and identify that 99% of the time, my worries and depression stem from hypothetical situations.

For instance, one of my thoughts was, ""What if my friends are judging me behind my back?"" (for context, this was after we went out for drinks). The key phrase in that being 'What if', meaning it's just hypothetical with no real evidence to back up the worry. So, in my thought diary, alongside my worrisome thought, I would write down a 'Helpful thought' where I deconstruct this worry. For the aforementioned thought, my helpful thought was:

""This is a hypothetical worry, you have no evidence to suggest this will happen. Your friend's opinion of you shouldn't be taken seriously anyway. You don't need to seek approval from your friends.""

Of course, this may not help everyone, but I wanted to share how thought diaries have helped my mental health, and they can be quite powerful.

 TL;DR: My therapist recommended keeping a ""thought diary"" and practicing breathing techniques to help my anxiety and depression. Writing down my thoughts and using the breathing technique has helped me identify that 99% of my worries are hypothetical. I recommend trying it out.",4

Then it gets worse and I’ll start to get angry easily, hit stuff, yell at people over the smallest things, get drunk or high with anything close by. I’ll do illegal shit, steal stuff or try to harm myself either by relapsing, staying awake until passing out or straight up attempting suicide because why not. 
And everyone blames me for it. In their eyes I am choosing to destroy the supposed progress from my depressive episodes; “Why would you do that to yourself?” and “I thought you were doing better.” No, I’m fucking not.

It’s dumb I know it shouldn’t make me so angry but I hate that no one around me is capable of grasping the fact that I’ll always be sick- that it’s not something that will just leave.

1720,"Manic only when on SSRIs I am 37F. I have had two severe psychotic manic episodes in the last two years.  Both times, I was on Zoloft.

For the first one in summer 2021, the pharmacy messed up my Zoloft dose and I was taking 1.5 times as much as I should’ve been.  It was a euphoric mania, and it occurred during a period of extreme stress from a divorce as well. I also started taking a 5-htp supplement around the time of my episode. I was hospitalized. I was also on lamotrigine at the time. 

I gained a ton of weight from both the antipsychotics and lithium. I went off antipsychotic first, seroquel, that caused me to gain around a pound every single day. Lithium I stayed on longer but I gained around 5 pounds a month. 

I then fell into a severe depression.  Like unbelievably severe. I thought I had had severe depressive episodes before, but I was wrong. I was not functional and planning my suicide. My psychiatrist initially refused to prescribe an SSRI, or put me on vyvanse, what I used to take for adhd and also helped with depression. I eventually talked him into it, I can’t remember exactly how.  I was also on lamotragine I think I would’ve died if I had not been out on Zoloft at that time. But it was a lower dose. 

Fast forward, during a time of work stress maybe 6 months later, I slipped into a more agitated mania. I was also on lamotrigine.  I was again hospitalized, stopped taking Zoloft and vyvanse, and went on Zyprexa and lithium. 

Weight gain with Zyprexa was still significant but leveled out relatively quickly, and lithium doesn’t seem to be an issue this time.

After writing a book, I guess my main question is- does anybody here only go manic on SSRIs?  In the past the one other time I was on one it caused rapid mood cycling, and so did Zoloft until I was on lamotrigine. I’ve been labeled as bipolar I, which I initially  talked him out of and he changed it to not otherwise specified, until I had my second one. I’ve been told the average age for first mania for a woman is 31, and I was 35.  But I don’t think it was a coincidence they were both on Zoloft.

1750,"Minimal success for 8 months Hi! I'm headed into work, so going to just get this out fast in hopes someone can give me advice.

I have been at home for almost 4 years with mostly depression, some hypo mania, and one scary manic episode brought on by an antidepressant. I also have extreme anxiety and adhd.

I started Lithium in August and was able to help my husband at work within a month. I came out of my shell, began to make eye contact, conversation, and was hired on as an administrative assistant. My career was teaching, but I know I can not be that person anymore. 

I have struggled the whole time, but was managing okay enough to continue. I am not okay again. Work is stressful in an unreasonable way and I can feel myself crashing. I am terrified of becoming the hermit I was for 4 years. I was hospitalized last March wanting to die from so much empty. I need to keep a purpose.

Anxiety is almost unbearable and the empty, I can't do it anymore feeling is taking over. Music and TV feels fake and every task is a huge effort. These are some of my signs. I am back to needing ativan to function most days and adderal the others. How can I prevent a full crash? Help!

Current meds:
Lithium 600mg at night
Ativan a couple times a week and increasing 
Adderal when I am paralyzed several days a week.
I just added 500 mg magnesium glycinate and Vit D3.
Any words of wisdom are appreciated.",2

(You might be thinking why don’t I just leave the house, Currently I’m in final semester of my grad degree, I don’t wanna ruin my career for these fights) as I am growing older, these things are getting hold of me and I’m becoming more and more sad, lonely, socially detached. Always thinking of how lucky I would be if I just had a easy death instead of suffering, I’m uncertain of future as well which scares me and I find death to be better choice.

1755,"I’m worried I’m second choice I met a guy on a trip two years ago. He told mutual friends that he liked me, and he asked them not to tell me, but they did. When he found out that I knew, he cut off all contact with me. Two months later, he and his girlfriend broke up. I have to admit that before he was single, I'd look at his TikToks a lot. I never liked or commented on it; I'd just watch the videos.

A few days before he and his girlfriend broke up, I noticed that my TikToks would go up. I had 3 followers, but whenever I'd watch his videos, a few hours later, my TikTok views would rise. I even tried doing it on certain days; eg. I'd watch his videos one day, watch it two days later, then the day after, and each time I saw them, my views went up, and on the days that I didn't watch them, they stayed the same. This continued for the better part of a year. Last year, it was still frequent, but less so. Now, it's every two or three weeks that we do this. One time, he even posted a TikTok in English (English isn't his first language, and all of his previous videos were in his native language).

TikTok wasn't the only platform he was looking at me on. He would do it on Twitter too. One time, I retweeted a picture of a Star Wars character. Less than an hour later, he posted a meme of that same character. The meme was in English, and it's not that I want to say that the meme wasn't funny, but it was obvious that he posted it just to post it. There's been at least three other instances where he did something similar.

However, twice he did things that tickled me funny. About six months after they broke up, he started following her on TikTok, but unfollowed her within a few hours (probably because she didn’t follow him back). A month later, one of his ex's close friends posted a TikTok video with his ex in it. He started following this friend. Around eight months of this going on, he made his Instagram and TikTok private. I have no idea why. But I can tell he still looks at my TikTok, because TikTok tells who looks at your profile. I don’t post much, and he looks at it every two to three days.",3

1766,"So it's back So for a few weeks I've been wondering if I was going on a hypomanic episode. Ive been diagnosed bp 2 a year ago and since medicated, found a combo that works for me since november 22. Before that it was either really depressed and a bit of mixed and latest major hypomanic episode in summer 2021. 

So it had been a while and the thing is, I'm still very slow and sleep a lot, but compared to before when I slept 10-12 hours a night every 24h now I still sleep 10-12h but  I stay awake 24h+ multiple times a week.

Last friday I went to my psychiatrist and he asked me if I had any hints of impulsivity that could indicate hypomania, specifically spznding, sex and substance abuse (ya know the usual menu).
And I thought about it for a moment (in retrospect I was making up excuses that would make things logical) and then said no, just spending but for necessary stuff.

And here I am exactly a week later, wearing one of my two new wigs that arrived from aliexpress yesterday (I had only bought one super cheap one before), been smoking weed since monday and unpacking my new dildo in my newly fairyland garden themed decorated kitchen. Oh also received 150 bucks worth of beauty products (I've never done skincare before in my life except sheet masks and face creams from aldi).
For clarification I bought it all before seeing my psychiatrist and smoking again.

1773,"Disillusioned by therapy Maybe I'm being too critical, but I feel like therapy has not been helpful to me. I had finally reached out for help just before the pandemic and was seeing a therapist. She was extremely nice and it did help finally having someone to talk to. When everything switched to remote sessions during the pandemic, it seemed like she rushed through our sessions and sometimes they would be over in 15 minutes. I didn't confront her about this. I ended up just ghosting. I'm not happy with myself for doing that, but it's part of this illness I guess. 

I then went through my local university because I had read they had a good social anxiety program and saw a few a student therapists, again all very nice people,  but I still felt stuck. About a year after seeing a few student therapists, I was informed my current student therapist was finishing their program and that I would need to find a new therapist outside of their program. They offered to show me how to find one on Psychology Today. I was already well aware of how to do this and was a bit surprised with how it seemed like they were just dumping me off.

I'm 31 years old. It took me decades to finally ask for help. I'm not blaming anyone and I need to put in the work to succeed,  but I have to say I was a bit disillusioned by the whole therapy experience. Just being honest.",3
1774,"For anyone struggling with fairly severe anxiety episodes - I highly recommend DBT distress tolerance skills. I recently started DBT after anxiety and depression became nearly unbearable for me, and the specific distress tolerance skills and suggestions (like hundreds of ideas about specific activities to do when feeling any kind of way) has been the most life changing thing I've learned. I know DBT is expensive and inaccessible to a lot of people, but [here is a link](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/577d2ce937c58194f7d39816/t/60c7e92fa3583448b8c6fa19/1623714139969/dbt_skills_training_handouts_and_worksheets_-_linehan_marsha_srg_.pdf) to the PDF my group uses. The distress tolerance section has a plethora of information and strategies to combat anxiety and low moods, and I highly suggest just taking a look in case anything jumps out at you. My personal favorite is the TIP acronym - cold temperatures like a cold shower or ice pack on your face, intense exercise for a brief period of time like jumping jacks for one minute, paced breathing or breath work (sometimes even fast paced breaths for thirty counts then holding as long as you can), all of which help trigger a system response that physically changes your state. Or very sour candy that distracts your brain for a second to snap out of it. Basically a bunch of tangible ideas to try out during a moment of panic.

The color literally did not occur to me when I got dressed. I picked it because I felt bloated and it was flowy, and that's as far as my brain got.

At the reception, my boyfriend's mom spilled red wine on my dress. As I tried to dab out the stain, I caught myself saying ""see, this is why I never wear white""--and then it hit me. I spiraled into an anxiety attack and left the reception to go back to my hotel to change. I felt like such an asshole, such an idiot, and I still can't shake that feeling.

I sat in the second-to-last row at the ceremony, at the very end of the row away from the aisle -- thank God. It was a casual wedding. People were there in jeans. No one said anything to me. And it was genuinely an accident. A very stupid accident. But it was also my first time meeting my boyfriend's extended family, and I'm now convinced they all hate me. I can't think about anything else. I feel like such a fuckup, like I'm a bad person.

I am 18 years old, I have a weak nervous system from birth, but a strong character, and because of three years of serious problems in life, the death of several close people, my nervous system has failed and I probably have chronic anxiety.**From below I will describe everything that I have tried, if you have something to say, I beg on my knees, help me**  


I tried meditation for 40 minutes a day, breathing techniques and much more of this type - but I came to the conclusion that this is not a solution to the problem, but a group control of my mind  
I have tried a very large number of different herbs, ashwagandha, sacred basil.Also, different supplements - taking longer than 1 month and zero results, at most it became a little easier, but it is almost imperceptible.Personally, I think that these herbs, supplements are mostly utter nonsense, which has a lot of side effects, stupid studies that were not conducted in real life or just made to promote the product  
I tried using reishi mushroom, cbd oil from a proven brand, tried vaping and other ways of using and everything is even  


Please do not recommend medications or any herbs of the ""kava"" type, which has a hundred side effects, it is better to die than to eat this shit.If you really know a ""magic supplement, herb or something else"" about which few people know and it HELPED YOU OR YOUR FRIEND, ACQUAINTANCE - tell it to me please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please

**Do not think that I am the type of people who have tried 1 product and immediately gave up, I am a person who ALWAYS GOES TO the END and will never accept defeat.I really spent a hundred hours analyzing this topic for the most part, and 99% of all the information is just a stinky slag bitch and it's impossible to fucking find adequate information.I searched in YouTube in different languages, also in Google itself for different queries in different languages, on Twitter and Facebook and found nothing working.If you have read this mini-post, thank you so much for at least thinking about the possible help to a stranger.All the best to you!!!!!!!**",0

So you know I (F22) have the best psychiatrist I could wish for and the best treatment.
I finally am able to be happy, because my disorder was type 2 focusing on depression, I was struggling with depression from 5 to 21 years old, thought there was no way out.

Today I'm kind of happy. I am in a healthy and loving relationship, that was unthinkable three years ago bc I was such a mess.

But there's some days like this one, I feel soooo sad and lonely again... And not because of an episode, but because of my life. I had such a difficult life surrounded by illegal substances and violence, and those memories sometimes just hit me. I just feel all the pain people went through, feeling sad and powerless against this sh**** world where help is so difficult to find for people with heavy issues.

My struggles today are the same as every basicaly NT person, but I have to live with those memories of people, friends, suffering when we were so young... And I still sometimes meet the same kind of people, 14 year old girls drunk and high in the afternoon with 45 year old homeless addicts.

im going to see a psychiatrist and try to get meds for it, but i wanted to see if anyone else is like this before i get it checked out.

i do not experience intense anger. like… at all.
even before i started questioning if i had bipolar, i knew that i didn’t have the ability to get angry. 
sure, i get irritated- but that’s only at my family members. in public i don’t display or even feel anger. 

maybe it’s because as a girl, any negative or ‘masculine’ emotion is seen as undesirable, but plenty of girls get angry.


i know not all people with bipolar experience aggressive behaviour, but i feel like i should at least be a little angry? i’m irritable at the most, and i feel like it’s the only trait of bipolar i DONT experience.

I've tried so hard to stay positive in the constant face of adversity, but I feel I am finally losing this battle again and again. Nothing has been going my way, and whether it's just bad luck or not, I don't know. I'm close to losing my job as well because of my absences, and I've nowhere else to turn. All of my coworkers and friends who have all told me ""I'm so sorry, let me know if I can help you!!"" go silent when I tell them exactly how they can help, ways and methods to help.. I am becoming bitter.. I'm gaining the mindset that they don't care what happens to me, but if they were in my shoes, they'd be crying and trying to fight just as much..   


I just.. feel so empty at this point, and I'm seeing no other way out of this.. I can't struggle for much longer.",1

I’m a 28 year old female and I’m coming to terms with my diagnosis, but I haven’t seen anyone or taken any medication since I left the facility. Does anyone else struggle to tell the difference between what’s “normal” behavior and what’s manic behavior? For example, I’m in a relationship with a wonderful man, and out of the blue last week I just decide I don’t want to be with him anymore and lose all feelings for him. And all of these reasons to leave that I keep telling myself sound completely valid, but how can I go from loving him and wanting to marry him to just complete indifference? When I get like this I turn cold towards him and want nothing to do with him. I feel annoyed when he tries to talk to me. Is that normal?

I work at a gym in the daycare center and as of late we’ve been getting an influx of gym members, which in turn means more children.  At my gym we have two different rooms for childcare. We have a childcare room for toddlers (where I work) and then we have “kids club” for elementary school age kids. There is more than the age difference between the two rooms. Kids club is a much larger room and has more mature toys such as monster high dolls, Jenga, and a giant connect four. This room is better equipped for a larger group of kids. The other room is basically a glorified supply closet which is perfect for small children. 
Now we got that out of the way I can get to why I’m here: 
Between these two room there is supposed to be two people working, one in child care and one in kid’s club, but as of late I’ve been the only person scheduled for any form of daycare. It’s  been extremely difficult to manage the toddlers and making sure the older kids are okay. I’ve been stressing so hard about making sure everyone is safe and enjoying themselves while I have 3 toddlers crying to be picked up and now I have two special needs children now. The right side of my face and neck is breaking out in hives. I need a new job.",0

1895,"Has ""tough love"" ever worked on any of you? My family is a very ""tough love"" type of family. As far back as I can remember, my parents and sister have tried to get me to change my bad ways/habits through ""tough love"", but all the problems they would try to use it for are still with me, so it clearly has never worked. Just as an example of what I mean, my dad would give me ""tough love"" in the form of telling me no one would ever want to be my friend or hire me if I continued to be a fat slob (true). And the other week my sister came over to the apartment and told me that I wasn't being cute or quirky by almost never cleaning, I'm an adult and need to start acting like one, it is extremely embarrassing at this point, etc (also true). But even though I know these things are true, hearing people phrase it like ""hard truths"" I'm just too dense to grasp doesn't make me want to change for the better. It makes me want to go home, put a gun in my mouth, and pull the trigger because to my family I come off as such a complete moron that they need to tell me obvious shit I already know.

I am wondering if this type of ""tough love"" is actually helpful for anyone, especially people with avpd, because in my experience hearing people judge me like that just drives me to start spiraling down. It's like it really does solidify the fact that I am so worthless compared to actual human beings that they always have to talk down to me, and my relationship with others always has to be me getting scolded even well into my adult years.

The court date is 6 days from now and I'm losing my mind, I never ever want to hurt people especially my family, I always tiptoe around them and put them before myself, but no one ever does the same for me, no one even realised the state I'm in. They only care about themselves and yet I always get blamed for their problems, worries, misfortunes, etc., I've only ever tried, I try so hard to make everyone feel safe and happy. I ran away from home, start abusing substances, lost so many people, have internal self loathing, deal with traumatising memories of getting constantly molested by my older brother, started self harming and not eating. life is a fucking cycle of everlasting pain.",1
1945,"Anxiety? I’m trying to figure out and address an issue I’ve had my entire life (or at least as long as I can remember). As I try to seek out treatment and help, I’m not sure if anyone here can relate.

I will obsess and fixate on completely mundane things. For example: If I overhear someone taking about a movie but I don’t know what the movie is, I may fixate on “Who did they say the lead was? An Australian named Ben. What was the movie? What was the movie???” and my heart will start racing and my breathing will get shallow and I’ll need to get up and walk around. 
Another example might be for me to see a photo of myself reading and I’ll obsess, wanting to figure out what the title of the book is that I’m reading. 
I might also obsess wondering what a logo on a shirt is, who was that guy that I helped with a flat tire that seemed so familiar, etc. 
You know how sometimes people will hear a song and not know what it is and they’ll say, “What IS that song? It’s going to drive me nuts?” For me it feels like that “going to drive me nuts” thing is for real. 
These “attacks” might also occur in certain circumstances of guilt or self-loathing.

One thing i am thinking of past few days is that when i knew i was gay at 13 years old, i avoided thinking about it and refusing to accept my sexuality. I only came out once i was 19. So 6 years i was 'locked' in avoiding being who i am. I am in my 30s now and after a bad breakup been trying to figure my life out.

Is it possible that being ' in the closet' for more then 6 years contribute in developing AVPD? As i notice i still dont accept my sexuality 100% and still think what people might think of it and reject me because of my sexuality.

first he said something to me while i was signing something. i said “hmm?” and stared at me for a few seconds before saying nevermind. from that moment on, i was anxious, thinking about him talking more and me not being able to hear him.

he did end up talking again. he asked me which side i wanted the piercing on. i said “hmm” three times because i just couldn’t hear him. he stared at me for a few seconds before saying it one more time, slowly and in a seemingly annoyed tone. 

i was so ready to leave the shop. he said to come back if i had any issues with my piercing.. i really hope i don’t have any. i’m already thinking about me not being able to hear him again and him staring me down while looking annoyed.

I (20F) was diagnosed with BD2 back around October, so still fairly recent. I am super lucky to have a family that encourages me to keep going to therapy and stay on medication, however I’m finding  they don’t really *understand* what I’m going through.

While I’m aware there’s no real way for them to conceptualize what is actually happening to me during hypo episodes more specifically (was misdiagnosed w depression at 17, depression I feel is a little easier understood) I’d like to be able to have them be aware of what an episode is like. I can’t exactly put it all into words when trying to explain it to them myself, and I often feel like doing that ends up scaring/worrying them more. So I’m looking for a resource that can detail what hypomania is really like, whether that be a day-to-day kind of thing, or just an extensive list of symptoms.

And now end of march im back in my room again lights off, headaches everyday, cant go out cant do anything, i can barely even be on my phone, lights all the way down and blue light off.

So I blocked them. No sense causing strife.

1989,"I can never relax my neck/shoulders/jaw...any tips? First off, I have PTSD from being in the military. I overreact to stressors in my environment significantly. So I am totally aware of having higher stress levels than the average person. But what I do not understand is why my muscles stay tense 24/7.

I mainly feel this in my neck/jaw/shoulders area. I literally (and not saying this like ""omg I literally died the other day when...but as in the way the term is actually meant for) feel like I cannot let my head relax into my pillow at night. It's like my body refuses to allow the pillow to take the weight of my head. I can consciously think, ""ok, I'm gonna relax my neck now and let my head fall deep into this pillow,"" and it works...for a few fleeting moments until I stop actively thinking about it. Seconds later I will realize that my shoulders are up to my ears again, and my neck is no longer relaxing. 

I keep my jaw tense all the time as well. So much so that I have so many chipped teeth that my dentist has stopped fixing them until they get really bad. I have a bite guard for sleeping, but I think the damage is also done during the day. I asked my wife the other day which was ""normal"" for her: when not thinking about it, do your top and bottom teeth stay closed/touching each other, or is there a small gap? She went with the small gap, and I can see that my body wants that to be my normal too, but it is not. My teeth stay chomped down onto each other, nearly 24/7. I'd bet my neck and teeth stay tense even when I am asleep. 

I absolutely hate this. I can never get comfortable. I cannot sleep well. I look like a 10 year old with ADHD because I'm constantly wiggling around while seated in order to get some sort of comfort here and there. And all this misery boils down to the tension in these 3 areas. 

Anyone have any suggestions for this? I've told my Dr many times at the VA about this, and I have muscle relaxers, but rarely take them because they make me super sleepy during the day, and if I take them at night, I feel kinda hung over the next morning. So I only take them when in absolute discomfort. 

I go to a chiropractor 2x a week. I go to physical therapy for shoulder issues 2x a week. I regularly use a foam roller and a Chirp wheel, almost daily, several times a day. I even started yoga this week...but I've only been once so far. 

Oh, and I get a massage 2x a month, by a massage therapist at the chiropractor, who can target areas of concern from my chiropractic file. So not a feel good massage, but one that works on working knots out and loosening ligaments (not sure if I am using the right terminology there). Last week, after several months, she was able to finally ""get in"" my upper traps and for a few amazing, godly seconds, I actually felt true neck relaxation. It was so wonderful....and so sad when it quickly went back to my normal. But that fleeting glimpse of bliss told me that it is possible to find relief. 

So I have finally turned to Reddit to ask for help.",0
1990,"Taking NSAIDs with an SSRI I know that taking an NSAID with an SSRI is not advised. But given that, do any of you still take something like ibuprofen or naproxen anyway? I’m not asking because I plan to use the comments as a permission slip for me to do the same. I’m going to ask my doctors and work with them.

I suffer from back pain, and naproxen is super effective for me. I’d like to restart Zoloft, but I’m concerned about the impact on my health when used with an NSAID. I have a couple of doc visits scheduled to see what they can do for me, and if there is any way I can do this safely or with minimal risk.

But in the meantime, I’m curious what your experience is. Does your doc make you do blood work every so often while you take an NSAID? Did they put you on a different med? Do you just stick it out during pain and not take those types of drugs? Do you do physical therapy? Etc?

1991,"Horrible Fear of Food Being Drugged Lately I’ve been having this massively irrational fear of my food being laced with LSD or some other form of psychedelics.  I won’t eat something that’s been already opened regardless of whether or not it’s mine, which has led to me not only wasting food, but actively avoiding eating unless I make it right there, and even then it takes quite a bit of effort.  This in turn has also led me to having a fear of an undiagnosed mental illness, and I can’t quite afford to go to a doctor currently to figure out if that is the case.

I’ve only ever been technically “drugged” once when the cannabis my friend bought was laced with PCP a few months ago but this fear extends back to when I was around fifteen (twenty three now).  I’ve done acid only twice and while I did enjoy it, it’s not something I’m likely to do again, and I rarely smoke cannabis or drink, but I did do a lot of both for a few years.

  Obviously nobody is gonna waste good acid on me but the fear is constantly there to the point that I yelled at my brother the other day for jokingly pretending to drop something into my Gatorade on the way to work (he’s unaware of this fear) and threw it away despite it being completely full, and even avoided eating the cookies my mom brought down for Christmas, which made me feel awful as there is absolutely no way my mom would ever do anything like that to me.

I’m iffy on telling anybody close to me about this fear for a few reasons, the main one being the irrationality of it all, but I also do not want to be sent to an inpatient center (again, can’t afford it) as I was for depression as a minor.  Sorry for the rambling wall of text but I just need to know if this is signs of a more major illness or at the very least how I can possibly cope with it.",4

I can't talk to any of my friends or family because I just feel comfortable and honestly I just feel so alone in the world. I have so many things I wanna do and so many reasons to keep on going yet they just don't feel like enough lately.

2000,"Having huge anxiety about my second emergency dentist appointment tomotrow I scheduled an emergency tooth extraction appointment last Saturday with my dentist who I haven't been able to go to in over a year due to lack of insurance/unemployment. My partner went with me as support and also because I can't drive. The dentist receptionist lectured me for not coming in for over a year, for scheduling an emergency extraction on a Saturday afternoon, and then said they wouldn't be able to extract it that day because they ""needed to see if the tooth could be saved"" despite me saying I can't afford any other option like a root canal. They also, despite me putting my preferred name in their site portal when I first started seeing them, keep misgendering and deadnaming me even though I told them last time that I prefer my preferred name and go by he/him (I am a grown ass medically but not surgically transitioned trans man). My partner, who also goes to this dentist but has had only good experiences with them, was apparently disgusted with how the receptionists treated me this time and now refuses to go back to them for their visits. But I paid $100 ahead of time for this tooth extraction tomorrow (because the receptionists basically forced me into it by showing me all the other pricing options without insurance) so I have to go back to them before I can move to a new dentist office. My partner is working tomorrow and can't go with me, so I'm basically dreading having to hear my deadname and being misgendered and lectured and all that bullshit all over again but on my own this time. Like, it's stressing me out to the point of almost crying. I don't usually get this worked up over being misgendered because like, I'm kinda fat and my facial hair is scraggly so I get a lot of misgendering from customers whenever I'm working retail jobs, but something about them *knowing* my preferred name and having been *told* about it before but choosing to ignore it is just...

I don't deserve support from others, I don't deserve to make small gains for myself.

 **How Mindfulness replaces medication to reduce anxiety**

Care works similarly as well as a prescription to check nervousness, concentrate on finds

A care contemplation course might be as successful at lessening uneasiness as a typical medicine, as per another review.

The exploration, distributed on November 9 in JAMA Psychiatry, involved a gathering of 276 grown-ups with untreated uneasiness problems. A big part of the patients was haphazardly chosen to take 10 to 20 mg of escitalopram, the nonexclusive type of Lexapro, a typical medicine used to treat nervousness and wretchedness. The other half were relegated to an eight-week course in care-based pressure decrease.

The outcomes were dazzling: The two gatherings experienced about a 20% decrease in their tension side effects over the eight-week time span.

Elizabeth Hoge, the lead creator on the review and the overseer of the Tension Issues Exploration Program at Georgetown College Clinical Center, let CNN know that she trusts the examination can open up greater treatment choices for patients with uneasiness.

A manager who is visibly pushing down a panic attack each moment, choking on words and shaky hands. And you're too scared to ask to step down bc you already done so 3 times..

It's my first international position and my first time living abroad. And I've never been so stressed with my spoken English.
Last week, twice during a meeting, my boss mentioned it in front of everyone. Everyone with such a diverse background compared to my mediocre one. Since this situation, my confidence has disappeared, and I have felt that my spoken English has worsened.
At the same time, I've been so paranoid about it, that I noticed some behaviors that worried me (like being fixed on only consuming English content, avoiding and culprit myself for even thinking in my native language).
I'm petrified. I feel I'm losing the respect of my colleagues...

2082,"Restricting stressors on devices. help! Hi all, I thought this would be a good place to ask.

Sometimes its best for my stress and anxiety to flat out block apps and websites that cause me stress. I have a very bad habit of wanting to dig things up from the past, even if they would hurt me, and often times the best way for me to combat this is to restrict myself from accessing social media.

Right now I've been using an app called 'Freedom' which has been very useful. The issue? I've figured out how to disable it whenever I want. Knowing that at any point I could breach the restrictions I put in place just makes me super anxious. I'm able to go into the VPN settings and turn off 'connect on demand' which allows me to bypass the block.

Does anyone know any surefire way I can block things, and not have access to them? being able to set a block on social media for 24 hours is often the best way I can get back on track with my day, and stop stressing over digging up things that would hurt me. Is self discipline my only option, or is there a better way?",0

Relaxing is benefacial to the human mind and body, by allowing yourself to recover you can do work more efficiently, have more energy to exercise and learn, do hobbies and chores, to foster relationships, and more. Machines even new to relax and chill a bit to avoid overheating or to have time to oil up or change new parts.

2143,"Anyone else from a minority community, nationality, ethnic group, religion, or race and feel like an outcast everywhere? Apart from moving many times during childhood and teenage years I have one parent who was Jewish and one who was Hispanic/Puerto Rican. They divorced when I was young (Stevie Wonder could see that one coming) and as a result I never felt like I belonged with any community. I never learned Spanish, never really learned all that much about being Jewish or Puerto Rican (my mother was Americanized) except the basic stuff. I was also too isolated to feel like a belonged to the average American culture in general and never really picked up on all the pop-culture that went along with it. I've always felt like an outcast and outsider partly because of this. Although at the same time I feel like I'm a failure/coward because I see many people who are part of a minority group who are able to handle themselves just fine and I'm white on top of that so I didn't really have it that hard. You can tell I may be Jewish because of some of my facial features (lol) and I was sometimes teased and bullied in school/work because of it but it's never been as bad as someone who is for example dark skinned (in a western country) and has a foreign accent. Even then I feel people like that had their own community to fall back to though and I feel lost almost. Idk, forgive my rambling...

I have no particular circumstantial problems, traumas etc in life, yet I feel like absolute shit.

But noooooo I waste everything I have, all the resources at my disposal, and its funny because I actually am disposing them down the drain lmao. I am just acting things out in this elaborate drama I have constructed for myself so that I can feel like a victim of my own imagination, make up problems where there aren't any, and poach resources away from those actually suffering. 

You know I sometimes take a blade to my hand but I get scared. I get terrified, that probably is a primal instinct. That definitely means I am faking it all, right. If I really hated myself and wanted to kms, I'd be able to sink it deeper, with no regards to the pain. But noooo, all I can do is barely see the white.  Because if I was really wanted to kms, I'd have something to show for it. If I'm really suffering, I should've been able to cut deeper just to deal with the ""emotional pain"" that I apparently have. But wait, I can't slide-and-dice deeper - if everything in my life is all fine and dandy, yeah that's right. I'm a fraud. I can't, so that clearly shows I'm not in pain. can't even get a drop out.

2175,"Expressing myself I feel like I’ve had a realization in the last few months that I wanted to share. It’s that one of the ways forward with this disability for me is to learn how to honestly express myself without distortion, and to do that constantly without regard for the fact that it causes me pain and discomfort.

 I used to cope with my issues by putting on a mask of a personality that I built using self help books and a desperate need for approval. Basically just the ‘fake it til you make it strategy’. Although I became more conventionally likable, it truly did not help in the long run as I was never able to get close to people. Now I am back to an ultimately isolated life. But I’m trying something different.

It’s very challenging to me and not always doable but I think it is necessary. And that is to view socializing as a simple and honest expression of myself between others. When I have a thought or opinion or feeling, say it, put it out there in some way (for better or worse). Also, treat what others say as true expression of their being. This may sound silly but I think it is a subtle seeming thing that is actually big deal.

As I said it’s challenging and not always doable, this is because 
1. A deeply negative emotional and sometimes physical reaction to the idea of expressing most things in my mind for fear of embarrassment or rejection.
2. My brain going blank due to weariness and therefor not having anything to express.
3. The fact that isolation makes me depressed and lonely so the things on my mind can bring the vibe down.

But regardless I realize that this is what I have to do, and that watching myself mindfully and purely expressing what’s on my mind is the only way forward. Usually what happens when I force something out is that I brace for impact. Brace for embarrassment, rejection, etc. Usually I assume that people are secretly embarrassed for me for whatever I said, but whether or not that is true isn’t important.

I’ve been trying a lot of tools of expression such as music, writing, and drawing, and I think these are helping me learn how to express myself naturally.

Anyway, I’m tired of pretending. Im not sure if I will ever be able to speak without fear and shame, but at least I won’t have to strain myself into a ‘safe’ caricature. Maybe this seems like crazy person thoughts but I hope someone relates or understands.",3

2186,"Why accepting and even embracing my depression has actually helped me. Let me start that I used to feel shame and embarrassment about my depression. I used to hate myself and feel like a freak, and that nobody else ever went through the feelings I did. I was terrified of people finding out I suffered from depression, like it would make them think less of me and that I should be avoided and pitied. 

At some point, I had a certain epiphany, if you will. I concluded that depression is a normal thing that affects everyone. I have a feeling anyone who says they never get depressed isn’t being honest, or just afraid of judgement. Everyone gets depressed, and it shouldn’t be anything to be ashamed about.

I’m aware that, although everyone experiences depression, it doesn’t affect everyone the same. Some people, such as myself, have closed themselves off to people and made themselves a victim of this idea that they should feel ashamed of their depression and hide it from everyone, lest they be judged and ridiculed for it. 

But not me, not anymore at least. I think depression should be normalized, or at the very least accepted. People shouldn’t be made to believe they’re broken and need to be fixed. Depression isn’t something that needs to be “fixed”, it’s something that needs to be understood. The truth is, my depression isn’t going to just go away. It’s a natural, human emotion. It’s a part of the human condition, and only someone completely devoid of emotion would never go through it. 

I get it, it sucks to go through it. I know all to well, and can’t tell you how many times I just wanted to die. But i don’t regret my depression, because I believe it gives my more humility. I believe that by being more open and accepting of my depression, I can open up to others going through those painful, difficult times. I can show them that even though depression may never go away for good, there are ways to manage it healthily and effectively. I think it just starts by learning to understand and accept depression as a normal, human emotion that everyone goes through.

Some were *really* horrible, like going blind by 30 or refusing to help my cousin during an overdose as a child. Of course that’s not real. I can’t believe I said those things to people, but it felt like the only way at the time.

Through a lot of reflection, I realized that I expected rejection and wanted to control it. I wanted to make them see me as a bad person, because I didn’t deserve them. But nothing in my life (that I understood at the time) was damaging enough to cause these problems. My family taught to me early on that if you’re not doing hard drugs or jumping off the bridge, it’s not a valid mental health condition. I didn’t think I had any reason to have the problems I did, so I had to give people ‘fake reasons’ to make them believe it, because my parents told me that’s the only way.

Also somewhat of a test, like if they stay for this horrible person I’m pretending to be, they’ll surely stick around for who I actually am if that’s better. And it’s not hard to be better than that, given the severity of the lies I told. If they leave, then I’ll have been in control of the rejection. And they’re not reacting to the ‘true me’ anyway so the judgement doesn’t hurt as badly. Avoiding the spotlight by pretending to be another person.",3
2202,"Do I have a problem with my brain? Well I've had problems with things for a couple of years but it's never been so bad that I can't concentrate and only talk to other people at school.
 for example I was listening to the teacher the whole time and then she asks me something and I don't know what she said.
 and also problems like I want to read something and I can read but I can't understand what I'm reading until I can picture it in my head and that's not easy either and if I can't picture it then I can too  do not understand.
 and in German I've never had any problems with grammar and such and commas and everything just happened by itself and I always wrote a 1 in dictations and now all of a sudden I've made all these grammatical errors that I've made before and still messed them up.
 and I've never had problems remembering things, but now on a ö I can't remember anything anymore.  I forget everything I'm told and I always have to imagine it before I'm told things.
 and that has nothing to do with the brain, but lately I've been getting sick every week and my immune system is also deteriorating very badly, although I've always gone 4 years without getting sick (that has nothing to do with the topic but it has to be  say once)

My new NP who oversees my meds and mood seems like a knowledgeable guy and ran it by me to see if we could try new meds. He wants to make sure the side effects of my current meds aren’t affecting me too badly.

I am concerned because these are the only meds I have been on since being hospitalized. Lithium and risperdone are my so called “cocktail” that work with me.

ive been taking 10mg 3x a day for about a month (with some missed doses in between) and i do feel less anxious, but the way my doctor described it made it sound like it was a fast acting anti anxiety drug that calms you down after you take a dose, rather than one that builds in your system over time. if it matters, i also take concerta and bupropion.

As a child or teenager (ages 10-18) I was just a really attention seeking person. I said lots of provocative jokes because I wanted to be different from everyone, and sometimes I lied about myself or my family or other things.

They don't ever bring up anything I said in the past and I don't feel judged by them because of those things.

 But it doesn't change the fact that I really hate myself for acting like that. My brain keeps reminding me of all of those things that I spent years not remembering. I know that regretting it means I have grown and am not that person anymore, but I still feel so guilty and feel like I don't deserve to forgive myself or move on.

I’ve been following this community for a while, and I just wanted to share my story and maybe meet some people going through or who have been through a similar situation. I've never felt more alone in my life and I feel like I'll be heard here. 

I’m 21, and growing up wasn’t easy. I carry a lot of trauma and guilt from seeing my mom sick pretty much my whole life and growing up in a toxic environment. I always took care of my mom from a young age which made me very attached to her, and honestly, even though she was sick, she was really the best mother I could’ve ever asked for. fast forward, after a lot of treatment and a lot of struggle, my mom recovered :) and 2022 was one of her best years. she was very healthy and started doing very well. It was the best year for my family and me as a whole. unfortunately, that came to an end, and she suddenly passed in November 2022. That came as a big shock to everyone because she was so healthy. no health problems, regular tests, she was perfectly fine. Everything for me came crashing down. I've always had anxiety, and due to that anxiety, I was vaping heavily for so many years (6 to be exact) until February 6th, 2023, came around. I had one of the worst panic attacks ever, and now I'm dealing with so many symptoms. Got so many tests done because I was having so many stroke-like and heart attack-like symptoms. Tests came back pretty much all normal, and I got diagnosed with a panic disorder and health anxiety. My psychiatrist thinks due to my mom passing away so suddenly, and I also have an underlying fear for myself.

I'm writing this because I've never felt so alone. I feel like people close to me don't understand what I'm going through physically and mentally, and I just want to be my old self again. All these symptoms started so suddenly, and I'm scared almost every day, not knowing if I will wake up the next day or what might happen to me. I'm scared my own body will fail me.  I'm tired, and I'm tired of feeling like I'm in this alone. I'm trying my best to correlate everything with anxiety, but it's so hard. 

Thank you so much for reading if you did read all of this. I will be okay, and I will get better. I'm slowly starting to see progress.

In the past when I had read these, I never really understood them. I do now.

      I don’t know if I’ll have that positive and exciting outlook on life anymore. I don’t even know if I’ll have the motivating desire to want a better in life that I had when met my ex. Large part of me went silent. You could even see a large part of my died. The part of me that started to actually want to live and enjoy life..
I didn’t have that part of me growing up even into my early adulthood.  

  

   I listened, eagerly to her stories. I told her mine. I did whatever I could to make her dailies a little easier. To give her a reason to smile. If it was sending her dinners, a random bouquet of flowers with some chocolate and a teddy, or just telling her a joke..(mostly bad ones🫣)
I tried my best to show my person I loved her. 

To me she was the world, my tomorrow’s, my happy, my love, my life, MY ONE…

But to her, I was no one special. In her own words, “there was nothing special about me”.

She took the best parts. She got better. She had options. She chose. She didn’t choose me. I was the one she chose one she had no one else to choose from. That was what I was to her. That was my value to her. 

I have finally excepted this. I can’t lie to myself anymore. She chooses not to be in my life, and she chooses to ghost. I don’t know what tomorrow will hold. But I know I don’t want to see it. The pain within me only increases. They say with time things get better. For me it seems to be the opposite. I’ve always been different. Maybe that is my curse. I’m not like the crowd. Doesn’t seem to be a good thing for me, more like a curse.

**Mornings**: Wake up feeling shaky and short of breath, takes 30min of scrolling on my phone to get the motivation to get up. 

**Afternoon**: Tension builds up and I feel stiff and uncomfortable for no reason. Or have an adrenaline dump around this time

**Early Evening**: Can be 50-50. Either I feel fine or symptoms start up again and last for a bit

**Late evening**: Right at around 11pm or so some chemical switch goes off in my body and 80% of my issues vanish. It gets easier to breathe, my Heart slows down, and my brain fog lifts. Start feeling much happier too and its very obvious the constant subconscious anxiety has lifted.

I actually remember when I was little (29 now) that I loved clear, sunny weather. I looked up the forecast almost obsessively ahead of time, banking on those days of where there are no clouds to block the sun. Not even partly cloudy. 

It’s perplexing to think I was once like this since nowadays, I despise sunny weather. I genuinely feel better and more comfortable when it is cloudy with rain.

My first born is due in two months. Farming season is about to start. Constantly awake until 3-4 AM reeling about the real possibility of financial ruin due to the costs of having a child and the current state of the agricultural industry. The thought of changing careers only amplifies my anxiety x1000. That's the worst part, being unable to sleep. Sometimes I'll start to go asleep and the slightest noise will wake me up, or I'll just wake up in a full blown panic. I've been spending all day either being a nervous wreck and if I'm not outwardly nervous, my body is still showing physical symptoms of it. Almost like it's subconscious. Sometimes I feel like the anxiety itself is scarier than the situation I worry myself sick over. My other new trigger is every little ache, pain or cough I get I spend the entire day spiraling down a hole thinking I'm obviously dying and I won't be there to see my daughter's first steps and the farm that's been in my family for 5 generations will be sold because nobody will be there to take care of it. 
I hate the physical symptoms the most. The fast heartbeat, constantly being on edge, body and headaches. It's like even if I think I'm getting a rope around my anxiety, it's still there in my subconscious wreaking havok on me. 
I'm sorry if this was convoluted or hard to follow. I just don't have many people I can talk to, and if I can, they have a hard time understanding just how hard this affliction makes things. These things I'm worried about are valid, certainly, anybody who isn't nervous about having a kid isn't in their right mind I suppose, but having a generalized anxiety disorder coupled with panic attacks in the first place just makes it hell on earth and makes you not only question your own abilities but also question your own sanity at times.",4

2324,"Anxiety Impacting Visual Ability and Causing Hyper-Fixation on Partner’s Physical Appearance Hi all,

I hope I could get some opinions from the kind followers of this subreddit!

For as long as I (27 M) could remember I had pretty intense anxiety. As a result I overthink and self-sabotage a lot. About 2.5 months ago I got into a relationship with a phenomenal woman (21F). She’s so driven, smart, witty and funny and at first, I was sure that she was absolutely gorgeous. However, these past few days I’ve been wondering if I truly am attracted to her. I know this is weird, but when i look at pictures of her I find myself analyzing her facial features without even realizing it. I am constantly quizzing myself on whether I like her or not. 

This isn’t the first time it has happened. I remember the first time I went on vacation with my one and only ex I suddenly started to hyper fixate on each of her features and started to see her “differently,” if that makes any sense. Instead of seeing a coherent face, i saw a collection of facial features. Her nose seemingly looked larger, and the proportions were all off. Again, I know this sounds so weird. I pushed those thoughts aside and eventually got over it (she broke up with me for a completely unrelated reason).

I’m wondering if anyone has been through this as well? Part of me thinks I’m shallow for worrying about this. But part of me wonders if it’s the anxiety that’s causing this.

Thank you!",4

But whenever I have conversations with a group of people I’m comfortable with, like my family, I feel like I suck at having conversations.

But now every time that I see myself on the Kinrara I hate my hair so much, like what the he'll I did to my precious color.
I'm thinking to get dyed at home because I can't deal anymore with hairstylists and giving explanations, but it makes me SO ANXIOUS to not get a color that matches my hair. I just want my highlights to dissappear.
I'm feeling like a mess and I don't know how to proceed and I don't want to hear the others saying how I'm wasting my money after getting the highlights . I just want to feel peace at something.",4
2328,"Hello, You are invited to complete a survey for a WMU psychology department research project designed to assess treatment preferences among adults seeking treatment for a variety of concerns. We hope to learn if and how preferences for treatment change over time, and if patient’s perception of their treatment’s match to their preferences is related to the benefit received from treatment. The survey is open to anyone ages 18 or older who is currently engaged in mental health treatment for at least one month and four therapy sessions, and not longer than one year. If you choose to participate, you will be asked to provide some demographic/background information, respond to survey items about your preferences for treatment and how they have changed over time, and about your quality of life. The survey may take between 30-40 minutes to complete.",5

2337,"an inchorent story made cogerent by gpt sothere mught be a little additional dramatic effect  

A guy in the tail end of high school liked a girl who was his classmate so much but did not ask her out because they were friends. Also, the guy had low self-esteem. After they were close and sometimes flirted but nothing serious, they continued to be friends through college even though she studied out of town. Every time she goes back home, they hang out.

During college, the guy majors in chemistry, and during the third year, he got depressed and caved into pressure and had a panic attack due to not catching up in school and the idea that he is a failure to his parents. That resulted in him not going to school anymore. He did this in secret throughout the semester, so when the next semester is up, his parents discovered that he stopped going to school and instead wandered around town and wasted time in LAN cafes. During this incident, he cut off all communication with his friends and acquaintances. He was lonely during this time. After his family discovered the incident, his family already saw him as a failure, and it was clear from their eyes and the way they treated him. This got him more depressed and ashamed.

At some point, he realized he had lost the motivation to do anything productive. He did not know when it started, so he pondered and remembered when he was last motivated and realized that it was only because of his friends back then. Then he thought back to his childhood and realized he would rather not try to do anything because if he made a mistake, he would be punished. And if he did good, then nothing. Maybe he was not motivated at all because he was raised in a negative punishment methodology of parenthood. He blamed his parents for the things that he was, but he also realized that his parents did everything to provide for his needs except for the needs of warmth and recognition. He was conflicted.

His parents asked him to go to school after the school year ended, and he accepted. As he was ashamed of what he did, he studied in another town. During his studies, he realized that he could not make any meaningful connection with anyone at all. He realized again he was lonely.

During this second chance of studying, he heard news about the girl he liked, and he felt things. When it was good news, he was happy. When it was bad news, he was concerned. One of the guy's high school friend's fathers died, and he saw her again. It was weird. He realized he loved her and he now only loves the idea of her, a type of obsession of pain, as every future that the guy saw was with her. But she is now in a happy relationship, and the guy she is in a relationship with is great, and the guy thinks that they would be married, and the guy also thinks it's good for them to be married.

 After graduation, the guy returned to his hometown but remained unemployed. He felt lost and uncertain of what to do next. He often thought of his past mistakes and regrets, including not pursuing the girl he had feelings for and not taking his studies seriously.

As time passed, he became more and more discouraged. He didn't have the motivation to pursue any opportunities that came his way, even those that could have helped him grow and develop his skills. He spent most of his days alone, feeling like he was stuck in a never-ending cycle of hopelessness and despair.

Despite the encouragement of his friends and family, he continued to feel like a failure. He couldn't shake the feeling that he had let everyone down, including himself. He knew that he needed to make a change, but he didn't know where to start.

The future was uncertain, and he didn't know what would happen next. But he knew that he couldn't give up, even when things seemed impossible. He would continue to search for a way out of his current situation, hoping that one day he could find his way back to a brighter future.",1

2342,"Why am I still feeling frustrated and crying even though I know the solutions to my problems? (Struggling with making new friends) I've been feeling awfully lonely lately, I've been socially isolating myself for the longest time now because I was dealing with shit like sudden weight gain, crying over my past, or having lack of friends in my class.

But I know how to solve those issues, like going to a bar, talking on different discord servers, local meetups, or joining an interest club etc. Seems logical right? That's how to solve my feelings of loneliness.

But at the same time I feel like everything requires too much effort. I want to make new friends, but at the same time I don't want to and I end up accidentally ghosting people because of my social isolation.

2344,"Partner with chronic depression started ghosting me, seeking advice I've been seeing this person for about 5 months and until recently everything seemed to be going really well between us. We texted most days and hung out around 2 times a week on average which felt like a lot considering their time off and energy levels. About a month and a half ago they told me they were having a depressive episode. I've never had a partner with chronic depression and was pretty ignorant to what it can do so I was taken by surprise when they started ghosting me about a week ago. It was very abrupt and everything seemed to be going really well until then. Since then I've tried my best to learn up and it and it seems like this kind of thing is pretty common among people with chronic depression, especially those who've had a long history of partners who do not react well to their depression.  


Normally, I would not tolerate someone ghosting me, but reflecting back on everything they've told me about their depression and how they're dealing with it made me realize how much effort they put into trying to address their depression and maintain a relationship in spite of it. They've confided in me a lot of trauma they've had to deal with in their life and the type of thoughts they struggle with. Last time we hung out in person I could tell they'd been really struggling with some of those traumatic events recently. Even during this episode they had some pretty traumatic events happen back to back but still made an effort to hangout and talk to me with everything extra they were now having to deal with.  


I would like to make an effort to keep contact with them for a reasonable amount of time and hopefully get back to how we were before the depression got this bad. The ghosting still hurts, and it's totally possible that they are just being a bad person and not telling me they don't want to see me anymore, but after researching it and talking about it in therapy and with some of my friends who deal with depression I think it's more likely they're pulling away due to the depression.   


Over the past week I sent two messages trying to be supportive and let them know that I respect their space and want to interact with them in any small way they want. However, I've learned that these longer texts (more than a couple sentences) can be harder for a person going through a depressive episode to respond to and might make them feel worse for not responding. Definitely don't thing the messages were bad or anything and the people I shared them with agreed, but it looks like going forward I should keep messages shorter and easier to respond to with an emoji or maybe even a small response.  


Given all this, I'd just like some advice from those also struggling with chronic depression about how you'd like a partner who you've been seeing for as long as I've been seeing mine to communicate with you during situations like this. My current plan is to keep going with my life, but text them again a week from now and maybe continue doing that for 2-3 months or until they tell me to stop. I don't want them to feel overloaded with my messages and push them away but I do want to keep the idea in their head that I'm still here and want to be with them. Thank you all in advance!",1

No friends, no job, I messed up my relationship with my family by barely leaving my room. They all think I’m awkward and weird.

Feel like I have screwed my life up too much, I’m an embarrassment and want to go where nobody will recognize me

I can’t handle it anymore, I feel totally smothered. I just want to get out on my own even if I’m living in my car for a while. But I am starting to feel extremely guilty because I know she’s going to freak out when she sees the note, probably have a panic attack and call the whole family probably telling them I’m “missing”.

2357,"Wedding speech in a few days, social anxiety So I’ve always had an aspect of social anxiety within me, usually in groups of more than 3 or 4 people. One on one or in a group of 3 in absolutely fine.

I had some bad experiences of speeches and presentations back in high school and totally avoided it throughout my adult life.

anyway, before the date i sent a friendly but firm text that i didnt want to do anything physical, not even kiss. he said he would respect that, and he did. at the end i even tried, i said i wanted to kiss him when we parted. he said he wanted to kiss me too but we should wait for the right time.

But my initial honest reaction was ""I don't even know who I'll be by then."" I didn't say that out loud, but it was a clarifying moment. Does anyone else have this issue? (Probably.)

An added unwanted effect is that this makes me come across as flaky, disorganized, or unreliable -- and I'm not saying I'm definitively NOT those things. Bums me out, though. I can use a calendar app, I swear. I just do not know how I'll be feeling a month from now.

Literally the only thing keeping me here is the pay. Which is very good, but I cant live like this. I feel exhausted and broken when I get home. I feel like I can’t do anything after.

2385,"How do I stop feeling empty? basically I’ve been feeling empty for a while now, problably 2 to 3 years, which is also the around the time I had my first hypomanic and depressive episode. I feel a lack of feeling, sometimes I feel like I’m completely empty inside. the problem is I don’t feel this way only when I’m depressed, I also feel empty when I’m happy and life is good. I kinda feel like I feel less empty when I’m depressed, because I feel sadness, anger, depression. I can at least cry and feel things, even if its are not particularly pleasures feelings. On the other hand, when I’m stable I don’t feel anything.I have a few theories: 1. When I’m depressed I am in contact with my feelings, I’m completely focused on what’s happening inside of me instead of outside of me 2. When I’m “happy” I’m not in contact if my feelings, I get my happiness from external factor, in contrast of when I’m depressed I get my sadness from internal factors. So maybe when I’m stable I’m not in contact with what’s inside me.

Sometimes after trying to exercise, or after a day in which I move a lot, I tend to sleep for more than 12 hours straight.

There are no homework assignments, no projects, nothing to be done, but still.

To try to cope I posted for hook-ups on Reddit but every guy I sent my photo to rejected me - this was never an issue before but I guess now that I'm 30 I'm ugly. I'm not fat, I think I have a good body, must be face issues. I look really tired in all my photos.

So life sucks. 

I've stopped taking my meds properly because I hate them.

I've stopped eating meals because I don't want to go back to being bulimic.

I blocked all my friends and family because they told me to talk to a professional about wanting to start drinking again (I'm sober) and since there's no professionals to talk to 24/7 I guess I'm shit out of luck and better off not bothering them.

My mom did a wellness check on me when I told her I'd blocked her, which I said she could do.... but lol.

I bought my first vape yesterday because I don't want to break my sobriety and I do not care if I start hearing voices. 

And I tried to go to AA last night only to listen to a bunch of people whine about how hard step 4 is while I'm literally writing it in my head just trying to find a sponsor to do it with.

I recently got a lawyer to try and get SSI and last week I finally found out how to apply for General aid since months ago the welfare office wouldn’t tell me how to and kept saying they only had it for families. So the loan company that pretty much got all of my info and bank turned out to be scammers and Citibank is absolute trash and their fraud department is shit.

I have always resented the thought of maybe I’m depressed because it feels like that’s become the norm every person and their dog brags or says they’re ‘so depressed’ and I just didn’t want to turn out like that 
The things I’ve said and done to people because I’m insecure make me hate myself and it was just for a couple of laughs with my friends I just hate myself but in a way there’s a sort of comforting feeling with how sad and shallow I feel

About two weeks into us knowing each other, he shared a really intimate story of a traumatic experience that happened to him. He’s a empathetic person that cares for other people, but he gets angry over minor things. I'm 95% sure he's gone to therapy, because even though he will explode at the most random times, there'll be other times when he's really good at conflict resolution.

Before we dated, I invited him to my birthday party. Supposedly, a few weeks before, he was flirting with me, but I didn’t pick up on it. So when I invited him, it confused him. He thought I was giving him mixed signals. On his Twitter (that I don’t follow), he was saying stuff like “playing with people’s feelings is bad” and “disloyal people annoy me”. The next several weeks, he gave me the cold shoulder and really did not want to talk to me.

He’ll also roll his eyes or grunt over relatively things that really aren’t a big deal. Sometimes I wonder if the thing that I did even warranted a sigh or eye roll. I’m just wondering, if I got into a relationship with him, would it get worse?

I left and traveled around the world at 18 and developed some PTSD from a few situations. 

I came back, got involved with a very toxic deceptive woman, (she had untreated BPD), and this got me outcasted from my religion, which meant all of my friends and family. Then her and I broke up the same week, and I ended up homeless for 6 months, isolated. 

Many more situations continued to disturb my life and traumatize me, but now I’m no longer in a toxic relationship, but my depression is so bad I don’t even have thoughts in my head anymore- only rumination or flashbacks.

I have been the JV coach before, but I am filling in for our head coach who is out for the season on personal leave, there are a bunch of mitigating factors that should make me comfortable, including the fact that I know many of the players already, expectations for the team are low given our traditional performances, it’s a great group of seniors.

He has never been willing to listen to me, and when I insist on expressing my ideas, he calls me ""punk"", ""alienated"" or ""callow"". He never gave me a useful advice. He's extremely obsessive and unflexible. His neuroticism hits the skies. He talks with imaginary people. He's unable to follow the most basic social conventions, to the point of harrasment in very grotesque ways. He believes that most people, including me, my mom and my brother, are ""zombies dominated by the virtual world and the hegemonic imperial power that displays an upside down world"" (sic).

We live in Venezuela. He believes or used to believe that he was secretely the ""number two"" of the regime, that Maduro qouted his tweets, and that the Intelligence Service escorted him 24/7. He believes that his neighbour, who has been repeatedly harrased by him, owns the biggest child prostitution ring in the country.

Despite coming from a consolidated upper class, white family, and having opportunities in places like San Diego, he never worked. He never provided. My mom, who comes from a family of peasants, has provided everything in my life by nothing but her own hands. When my grandmother died due to my father's negligence, he inherited a ridiculous ammount of money by selling our house. He wasted it all in obvious scams in exchange for literal bottles of rum and whiskey. At one point, I felt anxious about the prospect of him not providing a HOME for me and him.

He has always been a parasite. When he could, he consumed alcohol in copious ammounts and acted very aggresively and disturbingly. He made me cry sometimes. He brought my mom to the brink of madness. His surroundings always smell like tobacco and piss. Now, he totally depends on my mom for survival. He's a eternal thing in my life.",3

I have bipolar II and overall it has been fairly well controlled until recently in going through this divorce. I had a severe  (for me) hypomanic episode followed by a severe depressive episode but now am back on meds, picking up the pieces, and getting back to a feeling of normalcy. I know that the stress of dealing with my addict ex plus the stress of the divorce absolutely contributed to the severity of these episodes so I’m hopeful that moving forward I will continue to be well managed. 

My concern is that in dating someone, eventually I would want them to know what I’m dealing with, but I understand people who would not want to be with me due to this condition. Obviously telling someone deep mental health stuff on a first date would be off-putting but I’m just wondering if any of you have found a good way to handle this appropriately??

2489,"Decrease stress by ADDING a hormetic stressor into your life. One of the best ways to decrease how much total stress you experience is by adding good forms of stress (short and moderate) called hormetic stressors.  Cold water is a prototypical hormetic stressor.  It releases stress hormones like adrenaline and noradrenaline but it is short and not extreme.   

We just launched an app that provides guided cold showers to make it easy for you to do them.  It is led by a Master Chief Navy SEAL.  We teach you a set of mental tools around tactical breathwort, body relaxation, self talk, etc.  These tools not only make cold showers easier but they also help you handle stress more generally.    

In fact, the best way to train yourself to handle stress better is to systematically stress yourself and then practice these tools while stressed.  If you do that, these tools will become reflexive any time your body generates stress hormones.

2490,"New here. A work related conundrum. I'm a male in my late 30s, struggling to find traction in terms of being able to support myself. Recently, I've only lasted a few weeks in a couple of different environments, retail and warehouse. I could do the actual jobs well enough but I get tripped up socially, targeted by others, and quit as a consequence. 

I've had a difficult time throughout my adult years sustaining employment. There have been times where I had long term prospects but they ultimately ended badly. This has me in a pretty desperate mindset and I've decided to seek services for help finding something suitable.

What I want, ideally, is to have a space to work as independently as possible, with low social expectations and predictable responsibilities. I've been doing some gig work off and on, which meets those requirements, but that isn't a reliable income (and you burn through gas). 

My wife, who makes OK income, is being as patient and supportive as possible with me but we need a second income, especially with living costs skyrocketing. It's crucial that I maintain a job so that I can keep the marriage stable and avoid homelessness, which is what would likely happen if things fall apart. We don't have kids so at least that isn't an issue at stake.

I should add that I'd never qualify for disability benefits given my education and work history. 

What have others done to be able to support themselves, long term? What accommodations, if any, have you asked for in a job? And finally, has anyone significantly improved their self-image and ability to handle the BS at work?

But again she is a child so i know i cannot burden her with these thoughts. And she cannot become the people i need her to be and her words are starting to sound like whispers compared to the screaming pain.

Everytime they bring up the pills it makes me feel even more useless than i already feel. Everytime I have to remind someone how to love me i somehoe loose the love i have for myself. I see you trying but its just not enough. When does the pain of it all end. Will i ever be happy in this life? Or should i just give up whiles its still early?",1

If there's someone I'm attracted to and there's nothing problematic in their profile, I won't swipe on them because I doubt they'll be interested in me.

2513,"My dad is a G 🔥 He has done everything for me. He has taught me everything, physical and emotional stuff.

He dropped his dreams of working as an engineer just so he can help my mom’s small business and watch over me easily

He used to smoke but quit right before I was born

He used to be in a gang in Vietnam but dropped all of that just to go to the US and start a family, he tells of how gangs of kids in their school would jump the fence and literally start fighting and shoot at each other with marbles using slingshots

He tells me stories of his childhood and how at one point at my age (18) he fought off 2 guys and defended his mom by throwing his bike at them

He is very easy-going and understanding. Street smart

He literally cooks for me every night even though I already know to cook for myself and every weekend we go camping, fishing, or etc

BUT. 

So far in my life, he has been my only friend and it feels like I failed him. I’m a nobody, I’m not smart or attractive. I’m not an ivy student. I’m mediocre with no ambition and going to community college. How can my father have this exciting life and look at me in the eye and still say he’s proud of me and loves me? How can he look at a kid who has never once been complimented by a stranger and call him handsome? Or how can he call a kid who never got a 4.0 or any academic award smart? Why does my father love me so much? It would’ve been so much easier to just end it all but he has to love me and make me stay. As I’m writing this I’ve been crying so much, I was so numb for months but suddenly during my 18th birthday and this post it’s all pouring out, it’s pathetic, I would never want him to see me like this. I’m a disgrace who will end the bloodline of smart and attractive doctors, soldiers, and farmers. No girl will want a guy who is this connected to his father, is there such a thing as a “dada’s boy”?

I thought it was because I write and type a lot so I started to rest it. Over the past week, my finger has gotten better but other parts of my body have really been hurting. One day, my shoulders were killing. One night I woke up and my back was killing. The next day, my legs were in so much pain. Now I am just feeling a bit of pain in my back. I am not really active and nothing traumatic happened to me either. I think I just have anxiety in general but these pains are really freaking me out.

I also got blood work done today so I'm waiting for the results. I shouldn't have, but I have been searching up my symptoms online and it kind of sounds like MS, with pain moving around my body.

2520,"Yesterday was so good but today it's back It's like I had a breath of fresh air. I was sober, I was productive, I was task oriented. I got constructive things done and even worked on hobbies just a smidge. It was so nice to breathe yesterday. Today I started off well and I kept giving myself projects to do. I repotted some things and made the mistake of posting a pic on Reddit. I wanted to share a cute lil repot I did. Now, I know I can't take things on Reddit personally, and some people left positive comments, but some people were judging what I did and telling me I was wrong for it. I sort of lashed out and started to respond to them, but someone told me off for it and I realized I was being unreasonable. 

It's not the post or the comments that got me. It's just that I was trying to do well and be happy and share a little of myself with something or someone  outside of my bubble. I'm a home maker (30F) and I'm alone all day. I have long distance friends, but no one nearby.

2523,"Going to the cinema This is probably a very particular issue and I’ve never really wanted to post about my anxiety but I’ve led myself here anyway. After a weed induced panic attack about 5 months ago, things have been pretty hellish for me. I’ve got a painful feeling in my chest I would say the majority of the day (anxiety, of course), every day.  Now, I love love LOVE films. I plan to go to college next year and study film. I’ve wanted to become a director for years now. As you’d imagine, that requires me to be able to watch pretty much any kind of film, whenever. But, going to the cinema, something I hold so close to my heart as being a place I used to love, a place I would go to escape, has become really difficult for me. I really struggle in the days leading up to going, takes serious mental preparation. I’ve been a total of 6 times in 2023, which to people who know me, is simply unheard of. I’m a big fan of the John Wick films and have plans to go see the 4th one tomorrow. I’ve been waiting a long time to see it, but I just can’t see myself actually going out and seeing it. If you’re aware of the John Wick films, you know that they’re probably the most “foot on the gas” and brutal action films around. Which I feel is going to really freak me out. In my experiences of going to the cinema with anxiety, I’ve never had to leave the cinema. I’m pretty uncomfortable being there but I’ve never had to leave. I think that the main thing is the fear that this thing I love so much is being taken from me, despite me having no evidence to support it. While I’ve been able to push myself to go all the other times, I just can’t see it happening this time. I know it’s a lot of mental gymnastics but if anyone has ANYTHING to tell me at all I’d really appreciate it.
Thanks :)",4
2524,"Driving Anxiety Hi everyone, I wanted to just put a note here to see if this is a common symptom people experience (even with medication).

Ever since 2020, I developed severe anxiety that seemed to arise behind the wheel. It started with little things; I would hit a bump and would spend a little longer looking in the rear view mirror than I ordinarily would. 

Eventually, it escalated to the point where I would compulsively circle blocks or pull over just to make sure that these bumps and potholes were not pedestrians. And if I did circle a block, usually there would be OTHER potholes or bumps, which would lead to a mental downward spiral that drove me, quite literally, to insanity. It was one of these spirals that led to my first trip for psychiatric evaluation.

After beginning medication, this generally subsided to a manageable level, and with CBT I was doing pretty good. Then, in December of 2022, my wife and I were stopped at a red light when us and two other vehicles were completely totalled by an F350 who rear ended us, travelling at roughly 80 KMh. He ran from the incident. Everyone was miraculously not seriously injured, but I’ve been set back to pre medication levels of anxiety while driving. 

This hyper-vigilance (I drive quite a bit) has now lead to significant physical illness for me. From stress, I’ve ground my molars to completely flat, and the tension within my body from being so, braced? I guess? And overly vigilant while driving, is really locking me up. I’ve gained a lot of weight, too. It’s lead to serious depression as I’ve built a life that requires me to have a limber body.

Does anyone have any similar stories to share? Or even just some relevant encouragement… I’m really getting to the end of my rope lately because of this.

Thank you beautiful humans, please drive safe and treat yourself gently.",4

Around 4 years after that, which is now, I started antidepressants.

There was originally only one girl that was attending the area I went to, so I thought I would be fine. Wrong. She seemed like she was new and when I asked her for the fragrance I wanted she seemed confused and said she was going to get someone to help me. She came back with two women, and they’re all staring at me while I say what I want. Then one of the women she brought back started asking me questions, I wasn’t prepared for this and I sort of shut down. She asked me what I was currently wearing and I lied and said I didn’t wear anything currently, then she asked me if I would wear something sweeter than the fragrance I had picked out and I just shook my head and looked at some other bottles of perfume. I acted mostly dismissive towards the three women because I was so uncomfortable and just wanted the situation to end. I wanted to get out of the situation as fast as possible so I grabbed a different fragrance that I was familiar with and told them I would just buy that. 

I had tried to prepare myself beforehand to speak to one person, because the last time I went there was only one person I had to talk to. Talking to three people made me so uncomfortable and I acted like a dismissive asshole. I thought it would be really easy for me since I already knew what I wanted and I assumed I could just tell the lady the name of what I wanted and she would tell me whether they had it or not. I also feel really bad for the new girl because I could tell she didn’t really know what she was doing and I just made it worse for her. And the lady that was asking me questions seemed very nice and I feel bad for acting the way I did. Now that I think about it, the second lady was probably trying to set an example to the new girl and I ruined it for her. 

I had avoided buying fragrances online in fear that the bottles would break in the mail but I will probably only buy them online from now on.

This experience made me realize that I also act cold and asshole-ish to everyone that’s not the people I live with, or my mom. But that’s also the only way I can speak to people, so I’m kind of stuck between don’t socialize at all or act cold to everyone.",3

I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety last year, but had probably been dealing with it my whole life.

I have a handful of medications that have helped me a lot, but occasionally I get these slumps of depression still.

I guess I just want to hear other's experiences with this type of episode. I went from high energy and cooking dinner to not being able to shower or work? I felt disconnected from my partner, like we were more in an arrangement to be married, not in love. That sounds awful, but my emotions just weren't there.

I feel so fucking stupid for still loving her despite the harm she's caused me. But let's get back on subject. Today, when I was signing out of work on Slack I typed ""Bye"" to my boss unconsciously, I've never done that before, it's always been, ""See you Monday,"" or something else. I held my 3 cats each in turn today and just wept and hugged them. I wandered around the house (I work from home) after work and just felt melancholic and went into each of the rooms and thought about memories in that room. I don't know what my brain is trying to get me ready for, but I'm scared of myself right now. I can't really talk about it out loud to too many people because if the divorce goes forward I might lose custody of the kids because of it, even though they've both said they want to be with me and she is the one who left. So here I am. I don't know what is happening, I'm scared and I have no where to really turn at the moment.",2

2580,What’s your experience talking to a GP in the uk about AVPD? I’ve always found GPs really unhelpful and clueless when it comes to anything mental health related.

2581,"Suffering but I don’t want to For a little context, I’ve been suffering from primary anxiety and secondary depression (as my former therapist would say). I’ve dealt with this, therapy and medications since the age of 14 (I am now 22). I am sick of it. 

I did the whole change in environment- moved 500 miles from home. While I was lucky enough to do so, a short year went by and with many significant losses, I’m back to square one. I don’t want to return to the medications or the headache of retrieving my backstory to yet another therapist. I feel defeated, I’ve worked on myself so hard these last few years. 

I read somewhere today, “depression is treatable not curable”. It hit me hard, I broke down crying recalling all my efforts. My question is how, how can we live with these mental illnesses without being pumped with drugs everyday? Or cramming therapy sessions every week to feel normal? Is it even possible?",1

2584,"How do you get through the process of getting a job? I’m planning on doing a certain diploma you need to do at least six months of internship for. I should’ve started applying for those weeks ago but I’ve been avoiding it because I feel like I’d either end up not getting the internship or trick them into thinking I’ll be a valuable addition to their institution — which I don’t think I would be. So essentially, I’ve been doing self sabotage. 

Now, the problem is that I’ve had quite a lot of absences at school, the teachers all know about some of my mental illnesses and have suffered because of it. 

I’ll need references for the application process, I don’t have anyone else to do that other than my teachers but I feel that asking anyone to do it would be putting them in a really hard position because they don’t want to lie to an institution about me being a valuable addition when they (think they) know I’ll only mess things up. 

Honestly, I just feel like even if I end up getting an internship somehow (would be a miracle in the first place) I’d somehow find a way to burn out and mess up once again. 

If I don’t go for this diploma I’ll essentially have wasted four years of my life and I don’t think my chronically depressed self could recover from that.

2594,"Trying to explain the main difference between Social Anxiety and AvPD One of the most common questions on this subreddit is the difference between SAD and AvPD. Lately I've been trying to put it like this: 

**Social anxiety:** I'm afraid they'll see how nervous I am (fear of embarrassment)  
**AvPD:** I'm afraid they'll see how inept I am (fundamental belief of inferiority)

On top of that, AvPD is more severe (prevalent in every aspect of life) and persistant (there's no periods where you DON'T feel it), whereas SAD is situational (you might not feel anxiety in every social situation and go through periods where you feel less/no anxiety). But the belief of being inferior has to be the main thing that sets AvPD apart from SAD. Because of this deep-rooted belief, every social interaction, everything someone says can be taken as rejection and therefore as a confirmation of our beliefs about ourselves. Even positive situations can confirm these beliefs ('they like me now, but once they really know me they'll hate me' or 'they're only pretending to like me'). Another thing is, the belief of inferiority often shows up *outside* of social situations: e.g. avoiding doing homework/writing essays or even hobbies because you feel like it wouldn't be good enough.

Does this make sense? Please correct me if it's too generalizing. I might delete this post later",3

I never learned Spanish, never really learned all that much about being Jewish or Puerto Rican (my mother was Americanized) except the basic stuff. I was also too isolated to feel like a belonged to the average American culture in general and never really picked up on all the pop-culture that went along with it.

2613,"Tips on how to accept my symptoms are just anxiety and start living again?? The last month has been such a struggle for me. I started having panic attacks where my heart rate would spike to 150-180. I went to my doctor in case it wasn’t anxiety and just had my Holter Monitor results come back. I had one of these attacks while on it and thankfully no dangerous rhythms were found. Just some high rates but not sustained so my doctor is unconcerned. So once again, this is all anxiety. 

My therapist thinks it’s because I started a new job last month and I’m falling back into my old health anxiety habits because “Stress compounds symptoms”. 

This has gotten so bad that the past week I haven’t even been able to leave my bed out of fear of my heart getting too high. Due to probably the fear when I cooked or did dishes my heart rate could get up to 130 then if I noticed and began to worry it went up to 160.

Now that I know I’m fine I thought I’d be okay but I’m still constantly watching my smart watch to see how high my heart rate gets then panicking when I see it go above 120 from just walking around the house but when I’m calm it doesn’t go over like 110. This happened on the Holter and it was normal. I know this is just anxiety but I can’t stop obsessing that I have a heart issue that’ll kill me. 

I just need help to take the smart watch off and stop taking my blood pressure. It’s just making everything worse. Yesterday alone, according to my logs, I took my blood pressure 50 times. I was worried because my bp was low when standing yet my heart rate was high so I thought it was dangerous. It happened again this morning and my heart rate got to 165.

2620,"Can someone relate or am I broken? I need to premise this with saying that I recognise that I drink as it is the only time I don't feel anxious anymore, and it's a vicious cycle. And so, please, telling me that stopping drinking is an obvious step I am taking now and it certainly doesn't help to say this to me now.

Recently, I have been feeling increasingly anxious and paranoid after drinking about things I may have done or said during the night. This is obviously even worse if there are moments of the night I don't remember or if I blackout.

After a recent night out, I dont remember going back home from the club with some colleagues who I am semi close with (im new to the job). There is basically a 200meter walk home that I dont remember. I asked, and I was told by them that I was very drunk and was vomiting, but other than that it was a great night and we should do it again.

However, I am absolutely convinced that I said or did something bad that night. Just like I'm always convinced I did something bad the previous time. That I maybe told them I want to rape/hurt/abuse someone, or that I was racist towards someone, or that I said a secret. And even if they said that it was absolutely fine, I'm convinced that they are hiding something from me, that they are waiting for the perfect moment to expose me. That they are all laughing/talking behind my back. I feel like I ruminate over scenarios I may not remember or know even happen, so much, that memories almost build themselves in my head and from moment to moment a memory is more and more vivid.

This is not a new thing in my life, I wake up terrified of checking my phone for embarrassing or illegal things I may have done, if there's a murder in the news I check the location to ensure there was no chance it could be me.

The same happens in my sober life. I convince myself that someone is angry at me so I will spend literal hours looking over a phone chat between us. Thoughts or worries plant themselves in my head and I cannot let them go. One day I raped someone, the next I have cancer. One day I pissed someone off, the next day the past is coming to get me. I'm terrified of getting out of bed as something will trigger panic.

If someone can relate to this then I virtually plead for a comment or chat. I feel like I am losing control of my thoughts and emotions and this goes for sober life as much as when I drink.",1

I have never had back problems, ever. Knock on wood, I’ve had no accidents, no sciatic issues, no joint issues, pinched nerve issues or broken bones etc.

That being said, I’ve been undergoing a lot of stress lately. The pain has been building up for a few days but tonight, I’m experiencing increased pain! Feels like the origin is the right side of my lower back and the pain radiates down through my butt cheek into my calf (pain is not travelling to foot). It‘s not a sharp pain. It’s more of a gnawing, dull but steady pain. Feels as if I’ve been punched HARD several times in the said area and I only get a bit of relief if I curl up in my side in the fetal position. 

I found literature online saying that stress can cause these symptoms but I just find it so bizarre. Am I really that fragile thay stress could cause so much havoc? I’m in my 30s. No major health issues. I did have mild covid 1.5 weeks ago though. The only other thing I can think of is the fact that I’ve been sitting a lot due to studying for exams nonstop.

a few months ago, i had my first manic (hypomanic?) episode. It lasted 1-2 months. 

well, after all of the weird behavior, i was urged to see a psychiatrist. and then I was diagnosed.

Ever since being diagnosed and given medication (my first time ever taking daily meds…), i feel somewhat at unease. Even though i have a weird feeling, right now i feel pretty stable and happy. i honestly didnt know medicine could change my life so much. 

But i feel like after experiencing my first manic episode, something in me has changed. Even when im feeling stable, theres some underlying feeling my mood may swing at any given moment. I am still working on finding the best meds for me, so maybe that may have something to do with it?

I dont know. did you guys experience something similar after your first manic/hypomanic episode? Did the underlying unease ever go away?

Sorry if I said anything wrong, i feel like there is still so much i dont know about bipolar. I had a great-aunt who was in and out of hospitals in her 20s for being bipolar, but she was shunned from the family from being addicted to drugs and leaving her kids. Any time i try to ask about her/her bipolar diagnosis, i get shut down.

It seems like a lot of her advice boils down to ""just do it,"" which isn't always a negative, but I'm not looking for simple actions to take, which is important, but CBT can be extremely disappointing. I'm interested in delving deep into my psyche, but she doesn't seem as curious as I'd prefer. She doesn't ask enough questions and seems to assume a lot about me as if my concerns are simply general concerns, with general roots behind them. She talks specifically about surface problems, but vaguely regarding experiences and the reasons for problems in this life. I know that we all share a lot of the same feelings and experiences, but that's not what I'm interested in emphasizing, and to be honest, it doesn't make me feel better. I already know other people feel similarly to me, I already know that, but I also know that everyone's experience is different. People go to these pages to feel less alone, and it does help slightly, but that's not enough. I don't care to hear that I'm normal, it just feels minimizing. I want to connect with people but feel utterly incapable of doing so, even when I put myself out there and have conversations, I feel like I'm not really there talking to them, and they're not seeing me. My therapist wouldn't even see the AVPD, she thinks I just have depression. I don't know what to do, I'm scared to open up to her about my concerns, I don't know how I would do that.

All I want, more than anything, is a purpose. I would take a job even if I wasn't paid. I can't volunteer though. I'm simply not smart enough anymore. I'm dumber than a rock now.

And so, please, telling me that stopping drinking is an obvious step I am taking now and it certainly doesn't help to say this to me now.

Recently, I have been feeling increasingly anxious and paranoid after drinking about things I may have done or said during the night. This is obviously even worse if there are moments of the night I don't remember or if I blackout.

After a recent night out, I dont remember going back home from the club with some colleagues who I am semi close with (im new to the job). There is basically a 200meter walk home that I dont remember. I asked, and I was told by them that I was very drunk and was vomiting, but other than that it was a great night and we should do it again.

However, I am absolutely convinced that I said or did something bad that night. Just like I'm always convinced I did something bad the previous time. That I maybe told them I want to rape/hurt/abuse someone, or that I was racist towards someone, or that I said a secret. And even if they said that it was absolutely fine, I'm convinced that they are hiding something from me, that they are waiting for the perfect moment to expose me. That they are all laughing/talking behind my back. I feel like I ruminate over scenarios I may not remember or know even happen, so much, that memories almost build themselves in my head and from moment to moment a memory is more and more vivid.

This is not a new thing in my life, I wake up terrified of checking my phone for embarrassing or illegal things I may have done, if there's a murder in the news I check the location to ensure there was no chance it could be me.

The same happens in my sober life. I convince myself that someone is angry at me so I will spend literal hours looking over a phone chat between us. Thoughts or worries plant themselves in my head and I cannot let them go. One day I raped someone, the next I have cancer. One day I pissed someone off, the next day the past is coming to get me.

2720,"Why can’t I be above average at 1 (one) thing? (cw:mentions of ED)

My grades are average. At school I was better than others at languages and took part in olympiads, but now that I’m in uni, I just suck at everything. You can tell me grades don’t mean shit and how some smart and talented people didn’t do well in terms of academic performance.

So what? I’m not one of them by any means. I’m not good at scientific research in my field, either. They say, some people naturally think like scientists. They ask the right questions, challenge ideas without taking them for granted etc. I’m not capable of that.

I’ve had an ED which allowed me to have an extremely low BMI so for some time I felt like I’m better than others at least at something. I was dumb enough to try recovery and now I’m technically not even underweight.

I had hobbies like chess and drawing but I don’t have enough motivation to do them regularly, and anyway it would probably take years for me to become just ""good"" at it.

There are no other areas in my life where I could better than average. This is it. You could tell me being above average should not be that important anyway. It’s totally fine if it’s not for others, but for me it would mean a lot. I would feel like my existence isn’t absolutely pointless. I can’t just live and try to enjoy stuff.

2738,"I find it so frustrating as a highly anxious and depressed person to do career tests because they rely on your passion for specific activities and I find myself answering ""I dislike it very much"" to the various questions (e.g,. working in construction, healthcare, finance, whatever). I've been trying to get back to work again because it seems my severe depression and anxiety won't go away and there is only so much medication and therapy can help me. Of course, I haven't tried every kind of therapy but what had been offered to me at low cost. But I've tried many medications.

Anyhow, I feel very frustrated because after trying couple of online part time jobs (like writing marketing stuff on websites) and finding myself not motivated enough to work sufficient hours to make ends meet, I'm trying to start from zero again and do some career tests to find what motivates me. But those tests don't offer some magical information but just rely on what you're passionate about. Like they give you 50 questions and ask you how much you like doing different activities, like installing cabinets, diagnosing disease in people, giving financial advice to someone wanting to get a loan, helping a disabled person get dressed, playing a musical instrument in front of an audience, taking care of sick animals, etc etc etc.

I hate them ALL! None of these activities excite me. Because having a job is always about what others expect of you. But mental illness sucks so much of your energy that there is so little left for the job.

Like if I'm a cashier, my high anxiety and depression and the various thoughts and emotions and physical symptoms I experience will take so much of my energy to control and nothing left to put on a smile and make a customer feel welcome and at the same time do my job of scanning items very quickly and correctly.

That's why I've been trying to find jobs that are just online and things I can do on my own time, so that whenever the damned mental health issues give me a break then I can do the job. The problem is there are too many people doing these jobs and they pay so little that I've had to start looking at other options.

2742,"hi Hi,

I'll start by saying I've been diagnosed with AvPD about 2 years ago, around the end of my military service, but it's something I've dealt with most of my teen life unknowingly and now as a 22 years old still. I'm seeing a therapist for the better part of 2 years now and it helps, mainly mentally, not physically yet as I'm not doing much, spending all my days at home, no friends no social life no nothing. I did get a job last week which I'm starting next week, 4 hours a day cleaning some school buildings 5 minutes from my house.

But as the time goes I find myself daydreaming more and more about stuff I'd like to do like traveling the world and studying, I even got as far as signing up to university but ended up canceling it like 3 days before the semester started. Since then I'm daydreaming about traveling, going to south america or something..

Last week I said screw it and booked a ticket to Barcelona, for a trip with my mom and sister. I was very excited as I'm a big FC Barcelona fan for years, but as we all know, something has to go wrong. We're supposed to fly tomorrow and man this has been one of the worst days I had in the last couple of years. I feel like I just wanna disappear until Friday arrives when the trip is over. I feel like it's a task someone is commanding me to finish, and not something I ever wanted to do. It took me some time cause I usually keep to myself but shared it with my mom and sister, and now they're thinking whether they should cancel or go and they're waiting for my desicion. I also cried talking to my mom and told her many things that she didn't know like how I don't talk to my 2 friends anymore or how before I got this poor job, I was sending CV's and when people would call me I couldn't pick up the phone. I told her that I feel lonely even when I'm with them (my family), cause while they do make me feel good, they can't cover up for my non-existent social life.

Seriously I feel like a mess, I roam around feeling down like I've never felt before I think.

I have been on sick leave from work for 3 months now. 
Tomorrow I’m starting slowly again. 3 hours. 

Throughout all January I have had this persistent restlessness. I have been sleeping 4-6 hours every night, woken up, and slept again for 2-4 hours. Getting up at noon. The past two weeks I have tried to get up at 8, to match my work schedule. Now I only sleep 6 hours and stay in bed trying to get in the last two hours. 
It worries me that I’m still not sleeping through a full night.
I’m not sure if it’s stress or my hiatal hernia or my chronic neck pain that wakes me up. But I wake up rather abruptly. So I’m guessing stress. Sometimes I wake up with racing heart.

Speaking of racing heart - I started to get that randomly racing heart throughout the day. I wonder if it’s because I’m starting work and I’m nervous about it. I have social anxiety and I’m trying to fit into this new “me first” mindset. I’m a big people pleaser, but I have had to break with that habit now.

### Consider these positive signs:

· **You reflect on, and learn from, setbacks and errors.** You arrive at a balanced view of these and develop clear plans to learn and continue growing. People often repeat the same errors over and over, whether it’s overspending or choosing a partner. People have a strong tendency to repeat their behaviors. But you can choose to respond differently – and achieve different outcomes

· **You’re clear on what you want – and why.** Knowing what you want is the second key step in getting it (knowing who and what you are is the first). Knowing what you want differentiates you from those who aimlessly floating through life.

· **You use time wisely.** We all have 168 hours each week and the choice on how to use them. You focus on what is important, within the context of who you are and what you have chosen to achieve. You have the habit of asking yourself what is the most effective thing you could be doing right now. 

· **You’re making consistent progress.** Consistent progress is a great sign. Even when your goals feel far in the distance, regular progress – driven by consistent effort and learning – will get you there. As well as planning what more needs to be done, reflect on how far you have already come.

· **You’re not alone.** There are many people are alone in the world. If you’re not alone, you’re doing better than many others.

· **You’re committed.** You know who you are and what you’re about. Your goals are clear. They create meaning for you, value for others and legacy for the future. Great things happen when your purpose and your environment align.

· **You consider other’s opinions.** You learn what is resourceful to you and discard what isn’t. You live your life, not theirs. 

· **You are grateful.** You regularly reflect on what has gone well and – crucially – on why it has gone well. You have skills and strengths you don’t even realise.

· **You’re authentic.** You know you values and beliefs. You make your decisions and take your actions consistent with these.

When you’re clear on what you have chosen to accomplish, and you’re spending your time wisely, you’re doing well – and better than most! This is true, even if the results have yet to reveal themselves.

**Genuine Desire + Effective Strategy + Consistent Persistence = Authentic Results**",0

They say energy can't be destructed and I wish it wasn't like that. I wish I could just disappear completely from existence and leave no trace, I wish people would just forget everything about me so I could die without it being a sin. 

Is there a way to stop feeling like this? Cuz the only way to stop existing is dying, and I've already said why I don't want to kms, exactly. Is there a way to avoid it? Can it get better?",1

i started taking sertraline for anxiety about two years ago, which helps some but not for the panic attacks. 

ive started mirtazapine for sleeping which helps. 

but the depression is something that hasnt gone away. most days, its manageable. im good for a couple weeks, i do my schoolwork, i clean, im motivated to do everything and anything, i feel amazing. then for a couple weeks its bad again, i struggle to get up and go to school, my rooms a disaster, i shut down and it just seems like ill always be in this cycle.",1
2784,"Is it good to only focus on 1 goal? What I mean is, for example I have these goals:

1. Find a good job OR start and grow a succesful company
2. Find the one who will marry me in the future
3. Find out which religion is the true one / read the whole bible

So my idea is, I will only work towards one goal at the same time. If I choose goal 1 and I choose to study or gain work experience, then I will not read the bible and I will not be on dating apps, because I should not overwhelm myself and risk a burn-out. If I choose goal 2, I will be very busy with dating apps and alternatives, but I will not have a job and I will not be studying. If I choose 3, I will read the bible a few hours every day, but I will not do any other productive things.

What is the good side of this by my own thought?

1. Whichever goal is the most important one, OR has to be completed the fastest, can get priority and full focus :)
2. By only having one thing to work on, you have less risk of ending up with 0 free time, so you can avoid burn-out and instead, work at your own pace. (careful: do not get lazy)

What is the bad side of this by my own thought?

1. Spending hours everyday on the same goal only, can become boring. Some goals also do not require many hours every day: for example going to the gym. Being in the gym for 5 hours is a terrible idea, so if you have goals that require less time per day, you can actually pick 2 or 3 of these goals to fill your day.
2. Some goals must be worked on at the same time. For example, you should not avoid studying because you're too busy with going to gym. But while you study, going to the gym is still important for your health. So I would call this an exception to this ""1 goal only"" idea.

These days it seems socially acceptable that people do 3 things at the same time: study, have a job, have a social life. Where's the free time to relax? Right it doesnt exist, and even worse, sometimes all these activities take up more than 24 hours a day, which results in someone being overwhelmed and getting behind on everything. Actually this is what I have experienced. Its not a theory, it is very real.

I have a burn-out. I have been stressed 24/7 for a really long time, because I was focusing on too many things at once. I had to get my homework done, I had to spend all my free time on dating apps, I had to go to gym, etc, I had no free time left.

So my plan is to only work on one goal at once, and spend all free time as actual free time, to relax or enjoy it.

Question : is this a good idea, or do you see any flaws with it?",0
2785,I know I'm going to kill myself one day I'm drunk and I know it's just inevitable but hey let's take it a day at a time,1
2786,"Storytime... Hey, so... I've made some realizations in the shower as I do what most of us do and plan out the conversations I'll be having in two weeks because I know it's going to happen and I need to be ready or I'll just clam up and nothing is going to happen. We've all been there, most of us are still there, let's talk about what I'm thinking about in this little vent sesh. 

Alright, so I was showering, thinking about how akward it's going to be when I tell my friends some secrets. Wow! I know, sharing secrets! It freaking sucks!

So basically, I'm part of a church group, and these people are closer to me than my family because I don't like/trust my family and being around them is stressful. These friends that I hang out with all the time are my safe place and they make me feel...happy really. 

Though I don't share everything, these people are genuine and kind, and they always make me feel safe. It's just that, I am going on a mission trip with them this summer. Going to Africa, and it took them months to convince me to come with them. I still don't like the idea of going, but knowing that I'll be with them the entire time makes me feel much better. Besides, I used to fly a lot so the plane ride will be pretty nostalgic for me.  

So, as part of going on the trip, I have to do a few things. One thing that I have to do is research a topic on one part of the trip and give a presentation to oir team (9 people including me). I trust, love, and feel safe with everyone on this team, and all but one of them have been my closest friends for almost 2 years now. I couldn't ask for better friends. 

Anyways, the presentation I'm giving is in two weeks and I'll be discussing the entertainment part of the trip. Basically, I just have to research what kind of entertainment there is where we're going and make a small (mostly funny) slideshow. It doesn't even have to last 5 minutes, but honestly...this presentation is the least of my anxieties in this mess. 

Another thing that I'm going to have to do is share my testimony. That is essentially a summarized version of your life story. I'll have to talk about my troubles, my past, my family, all of it. And these are my friends, they'll know if I'm holding back. But it scares me so much! Half of them don't actually know I have avpd! They just know that I've been going to therapy for a while and that I started taking medicine. Though, the medicine is kind of iffy really. 

Anyways, I'm super anxious about it, especially since I did something similar last year, but that was at the height of my emotional suppression. This time last year, I was so empty and emotionless. But of course, nobody knew. I was always masking my emotions and faking a smile. I didn't even know I was doing it, and when I gave my testimony for last year's mission, it was incomplete and full of holes. I talked about my lack of friends, but I was blind to the emotional abuse and neglect from my parents and siblings because I had convinced myself that I was just weak and that my pain was normal and even less than what everyone else had to go through. 

But it's not like that, that's not how I should think about my past pain. It took so long for my friends to break my barriers, but they managed to do that and convince me to go to therapy.

 I'm much better now, but I'm also not suppressing my emotions. It was really hard at first because everything just hurt so much and it overwhelmed me. One moment I was putting on a face to fool everyone into thinking I was okay, but as soon as I was behind closed doors, I was hurting myself and cursing the world for letting my life be the way it was. 

The fact that I have to go and tell my friends how I've been feeling over the last year is overwhelming, but I am not allowed to go on this mission unless I share my testimony. It's only fair though, everyone of us is sharing our testimony, no matter how much it hurts, we're going to be here for each other.


If you've actually read this far, I just want to say thank you. You're a special type of person, and whoever is in your life is truly lucky to know someone like you. And if they don't understand that, then know that I am thanking you for the kindness you have done for me just by reading this. Thank you.",3

2791,"How much of your avpd surrounds your appearance? I've been told I'm pretty but I almost never believe it lol. I don't like attention of any kind, good or bad. I noticed that I have this weird perfectionism that I have to ""look good"" for people. Ofc you want to be presentable

But I take it overboard. I won't leave my house if I feel too badly about my appearance that day. I feel like I'm offending people by not looking good. I'm pretty sure this stems from ofc, childhood. 

I didn't care too much for looks as a kid, I just wanted to have fun. But my dad would constantly judge my hair, want me to change my clothes so I can look better. Every thing was about appearances with him. He would constantly look at himself, even in windows while walking out in public.

He'd spend hours getting dressed (despite having no hair, so I don't get what took so long 🤭). I noticed I've picked up the same habits. I care far too much for my appearance when logically I know most people don't care. And if they do care, that's kind of weird.

we ended up chatting for hours! just between the two of us and it was really nice, i had never done that before with anyone except my family and my boyfriend. i think what made it better was how much they understood the hardship of just…talking about problems, we both struggle with even talking about ourselves, went through some real shit together, and finding someone else we could really talk to without fear of anything happening was so relieving. they arent on avpd level like i am but they really get it

I'm sure there's others but just don't remember them. I've had side effects from the majority of them. 

Lithium destroyed my thyroid and caused me to gain weight rapidly, Risperdal made me incredibly stiff in the mornings where it was hard to get out of bed, Zoloft made me yawn for zero reason constantly, Seroquel made me aggressive and hard to wake up.

I’ve gone from being a textbook AvPD with such bad social anxiety I barely left the house an could barely order a cheeseburger.
All through school people called me “socially retarded” and my mom thought I was autistic.
To now being a very socially skilled, confident, outgoing person who makes friends easily.

I’m curious if people are interested in some kind of a write up about how I’ve recovered from my AvPD, what helped me, how long it can take etc?

I see a lot of people struggling and feeling hopeless on this board.
It breaks my heart when I see people truly believe that recovery is impossible (and spreading that false message). It is possible! It’s just really hard, uncomfortable, takes a lot of time and you have to really want it.

Thoughts on whether a write up is something people would be receptive of? I’m also open to suggestions of what else could help.

I have a handful of medications that have helped me a lot, but occasionally I get these slumps of depression still.

Before they always seemed to line up with PMS so I attributed them to that, but this one is on the opposite part of my cycle. I feel like I'm wasting my cycles best time!

Anyway, I'm struggling to find a trigger. Was there a trigger? I'll obviously discuss this with my psychiatrist, but I don't know. 

I guess I just want to hear other's experiences with this type of episode. I went from high energy and cooking dinner to not being able to shower or work? I felt disconnected from my partner, like we were more in an arrangement to be married, not in love. That sounds awful, but my emotions just weren't there. I think I'm coming out of it now, I took a shower, got my eyebrows done, and had my legs waxed. Maybe I'll pay to get a Mani/Pedi. 

Thank you for reading my ramble. 
Is this just life with depression?",1

2840,"I feel so shameful when I see how tidy and well decorated other people’s homes are Then I come home to a sink full of dishes, a carpet that hasn’t been vacuumed in ages, piles of clothes that haven’t been folded, cups and cans everywhere, and the list just goes on. I want to have a clean, cozy home with house plants that I’m proud to show off to people, but I don’t even feel capable of holding myself together for long enough to achieve anything close. I feel like a disaster of a human and I don’t know how to help myself.",2
2841,:) I think I’m finally ready to kill myself. I’m not scared of going to hell anymore,1
2842,"Help. I'm in a situation worse than killing myself. I can't seem to talk to anyone truthfully about how I feel. No one respects me anymore. Give importance to what I do, respect my job, see my importance, or even care about how I feel. I'm so frustrated to the point that I can only hurt myself but can't kill myself. I have a little boy that keeps me going but I don't know up until when or how far I can go. I'm trapped in this cycle for years with no resolution.",1
2843,"I despise living with my family but I can't afford to move out. I've been trying to move out for years but I make jack shit for my job. 

Every. Single. Day. When I get home there's an issue. It is always my older sister 100%. Whether it's getting back together with her ex that she got a restraining order against, victimizing herself over her kids existences because one of them is crying, or just being drunk, she is always throwing fits and making a scene, ruining everyone's day, for no reason. Let alone assault you for no reason. May God forgive your ignorant soul for thinking you can be in the same building as her when she feels like throwing a temper tantrum like a 4 year old. 

I've talked to our mom numerous times about her. She defends her every single time, sometimes I'll tell her she needs to stop enabling her and she just responds by enabling her. 

They're always telling me to pack my shit and go. Believe me, I'd fucking love to. But even though I pay rent you know they're always holding it over my head what a parasite I am and I'd be dead/homeless without them.",0
2845,"I don't like making plans because I don't trust my future self's mental state Sorry if this has already been talked about a lot, but I just realized that this is why I don't like making plans too far out into the future.

One of my friends recently asked me if I wanted to go to a concert in August. I love the musician, and I'm sure I'd enjoy the show. But my initial honest reaction was ""I don't even know who I'll be by then."" I didn't say that out loud, but it was a clarifying moment. Does anyone else have this issue? (Probably.)

An added unwanted effect is that this makes me come across as flaky, disorganized, or unreliable -- and I'm not saying I'm definitively NOT those things. Bums me out, though. I can use a calendar app, I swear. I just do not know how I'll be feeling a month from now. And a bunch of my friends are very ""type A,"" so it sort of compounds the issue because they love having full calendars and planning hangs weeks in advance. (Dorks.)

Anyway, I think I'll buy tickets to this thing even if I don't end up being able to go. It's just annoying I have to incorporate this into my decision-making. I can barely RSVP to weddings with any degree of confidence. That's all. Thanks.

2846,"Comorbidity -Multiple Diagnosis For the first time after a long standing build up of intense anxiety and depression, I sought out for help, diagnosis, and medication.

I was overwhelmed with what I got from 4 professionals, which include two great psychiatrists and 2 therapists. It is PTSD, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, and Social Anxiety Disorder. Medication has helped and having the answers of a diagnosis has been very validating, but I am struggling to piece all of these together and figure out where I am supposed to go from here. Has anyone else experienced these multiple diagnosis?",1

Roughly 11 or 12 years ago, I got the news that a friend I worked with but lost touch with had died of a massive heart attack.  She was a chain smoker, and gained a lot of weight.

The last three days all I heard was mistake after mistake I made, then yesterday I was told of a mistake and I'm going too slow. I think that broke me, I ran to the bathroom, was holding tears till work was over and got a Lyft home and cried. All day and night I couldn't do anything I enjoyed and thinking of the world made me run to the bathroom to throw up but nothing came out.

2852,"Best “I should’ve known” moments? Hey!

2854,"Feeling Overwhelmed? It takes more to overwhelm some people than others, but the feeling and the impact are the same: overload and not knowing which way to turn next which triggers a downward spiral of anxiety.

### Take these steps to create a plan and go from feeling overwhelmed to feeling peaceful again:

**Identify what you can and can’t control.** List your issues in three columns: what you can control, what you can influence and what is out-with your control. 

**Focus on solutions.** Now that you have perspective on what you can and can’t control, identify your chosen end point for each issue. Shift your focus from the problems to the solutions.

**Prioritise your actions.** Consider your chosen solutions in terms of how important they are and how urgent they are. Firstly, deal with the issues that are both important and urgent then move to the other important issues. As a general rule, deal with the important issues over the urgent issues: here-in lies the path to living sustainably crisis free.

**Communicate.** With your plan in place, communicate with those who may be affected: it’s incredible how supportive people can be once they understand your situation.

**Eat well.** Overwhelm commonly leads to skipping meals or over-reliance on junk food. Buy in some healthy foods and snacks to give you the nutrition you’ll need to play your best game.

**Gratitude.** It is easy to lose sight of the good things happening when we feel overwhelmed. Adopt the habit of regularly reflecting on the things you’re grateful for: that you’re taking control of challenging situations, that you’re on your way to calmer times, that you’re learning a lot about yourself, perhaps that others are supporting you.

**Blow off some steam.** Exercise – whatever works best for you: a brisk walk, hit the weights, an hour on the bike – has a magical ability to burn off that anxiety and re-set all those neurotransmitters. It will also help you get that good night’s sleep.

**Get your rest.** Know that you’re focusing on your priorities with a clear plan. You’re pushing yourself hard through the day. A good night’s sleep is the smartest thing you can give yourself to keep working through your list. 

**Celebrate your successes.** Each step forward is worthy of celebration. Be proud of yourself for taking control and moving forward. Each success leads to further steps forward.  
 

**Overwhelm is a situation everyone is familiar with. Short term episodes are unlikely to harm us. Longer term however, it can be debilitating. Remember there is help out there for those times you need support in getting back on top of things.**",0
2855,"I'm starting to doubt if getting better is even worth the effort and suffering. I'm still young, but I've been depressed for years now. All throughout this, people have told me many times that ""it will get better"". It doesn't get better all by itself. It doesn't just happen.

The effort that is required to start making my life better, and getting better myself, is something that I simply cannot put into it right now. I have tried countless times, and failed every single time. The more succesful attempts at recovering never lasted either, and it's always gotten as bad as things had been before.

Even if I do get better, is it even worth it? I'm constantly suffering right now, and my brain feels like a torture prison, that I'm forever stuck inside of. I could end that pain right now, instead of working hard, and regaining a bit of control over my life...

But this world sucks. I don't think living in it can even be that great. I'm not sure if I'm willing to dedicate so much effort, just to live in this piece of shit society. I'm tired.",1

2858,"Do you think he might be abusive? As someone with AVPD, I don't date much, and I just want someone who will be loyal to me. It's very clear that he's attracted to me. I'm attracted to him too, but everyone says that I'm way too pretty for him. About two weeks into us knowing each other, he shared a really intimate story of a traumatic experience that happened to him. He’s a empathetic person that cares for other people, but he gets angry over minor things. I'm 95% sure he's gone to therapy, because even though he will explode at the most random times, there'll be other times when he's really good at conflict resolution.

Before we dated, I invited him to my birthday party. Supposedly, a few weeks before, he was flirting with me, but I didn’t pick up on it. So when I invited him, it confused him. He thought I was giving him mixed signals. On his Twitter (that I don’t follow), he was saying stuff like “playing with people’s feelings is bad” and “disloyal people annoy me”. The next several weeks, he gave me the cold shoulder and really did not want to talk to me.

He’ll also roll his eyes or grunt over relatively things that really aren’t a big deal. Sometimes I wonder if the thing that I did even warranted a sigh or eye roll. I’m just wondering, if I got into a relationship with him, would it get worse?

2887,"Possibly losing parenting rights due to bipolar disorder The most recent manic episode I had was after being depressed and diagnosed with major depressive disorder to be prescribed Zoloft. Within 6 weeks I was staying up for 9 days and delusional. I thought my partner was going to kill me so I called 911. The police arrived and I was very agitated and explained my delusions and they took me to the nearest psych ward for an evaluation. Unfortunately, that psych ward didn’t keep me long enough despite my volunteering to stay longer. They also gave me a medication I ended up allergic to which took treatment even longer.

This resulted in asking my in-laws who live in a different state miles away to help me care for my daughter until I found the right medication combination and was stable. I knew it could take a few months and I had no one else available local to me. The only way my inlaws would take my daughter is if I signed over guardianship. I was under the impression it would only be for a year at the most. But honestly, I wasn’t really in the right mind to consent to that paperwork. I just knew I needed help and I did what I could to ensure my daughter had the best care possible while I got stable. 

Fast forward to now my partner and I petitioned the courts to end guardianship as I have been stable for 2 years. I have letters from my therapist and pdoc stating I am in treatment and stable and medication compliant. 

Well, my in-laws are trying to prove I am unfit for things I did while I was manic so they can adopt my daughter without my consent or permission through the courts. They're also trying to prove that my partner (their child) is unfit I am less worried about that. 

My therapist says they're on a witch hunt and that they're just trying to raddle me and no judge would grant them adoption. I hope she's right.

I gave everything to this girl and made a lot of positive improvements over the years but she told me she can’t handle my mental illness and that she loves me but needs to focus on herself

2906,"Emotional detachment For the last three years, I’ve experienced emotional detachment. It’s been so long that I forgot I have it. I have close to no emotional reactions to anything external. The only way I can make myself cry is if I’m pretending to be sad. I don’t feel anything and it makes me think I’m crazy. I don’t act numb because I fake my emotions. Even when I’m alone. I used to feel more. But now when situations occur when emotions would most likely come out, it doesn’t even feel like it’s happening to me. I could chop off all my hair and I would have no reaction. My sister got engaged and I had to fake my reaction. Whenever I hear news, it’s just like hearing words and that’s all. It doesn’t feel like I’m emotionless per se, it feels like I’m not even processing the situation in the first place. Logically, I know it’s happening but I don’t feel aware at all. Why is this? Is this depression? Am I a sociopath? I’d also like to bring up that I have been diagnosed with OCD. And I had a very emotionally abusive father at a very young age.",1

I have a loving family and I cannot do that to them. I am hanging in a superposition. A hell of routine that is not longer designed for me but for who I used to be. My study turned my passion into mindless work. I am too broke and too far down the study to stop it now. I have one year left. Therapy does not help and I do not trust depression meds. I am lonely surrounded by people. What does one do when negativity takes over? I was told depression means I am not in the right place. That my lifestyle needs to change. Yet...I am barely managing to do the little I am doing. I am trying to take responsibility for my situation and change what I can control but...it all falls short. I feel like I am chasing something but even when I stop and appreciate the moments it is just a fleeting break from the endless torture.

It feels that the world is going mad, each year they discover something else that we humans broke. From microplastics, carbon emissions to the impending doom of nuclear war. I would say that I am losing hope but I am already hopeless.

Yet...this is not how I felt just a few days ago. It comes and goes. For a few days I feel like a human and then I plunge back into this torture. Like on a rollercoaster. I am pushing away the little friends that I have, because if I stay silent then they still feel somethings up and when I open up they just don't like the negativity.

2923,"I think I have AvPD (avoidant personality disorder) I have recently come across AvPD and I realized that I relate to almost all of the symptoms. First off, I’m very anxious in almost all social situations. This includes hanging around friends i’ve known for many many years, being around extended family (who i’ve also known for many years), being around coworkers, meeting new people, and even just going grocery shopping. 

I often try to avoid a lot of social situations which has definitely affected a lot of my relationships. I’m not very close with my friends or family anymore. I still hangout with them sometimes but it’s not on a very deep level. I don’t really open myself up to anyone. I’m scared of people figuring out my true personality and that they won’t like me for who I am. I hide lots of parts of my personality and not one person on this earth truly knows me. I’m close enough with my parents that I don’t get anxious around them, however I still hide many pieces of myself and don’t feel comfortable enough to show everything about myself. 

I have also struggled to find jobs that don’t make me anxious. It took me until I was 18 years old until I finally got my first job because of this. I currently work at a daycare and have worked here for about 7 months and my anxiety has seemed to get worse. I have been thinking about quitting for awhile now but am terrified of having the conversation with my boss about quitting. 

Whenever I’m at work, I feel inferior to everyone else. I feel like I have less experience, I overthink everything, and I am so awkward around my coworkers and parents. I feel like I’m incompetent and people don’t take me seriously because of my poor communication skills. My mind often goes blank when I’m asked questions and I don’t feel like I’m much of a help. I also try to focus completely on the kids and I would rather not form any real relationships with other coworkers. I try to keep conversations polite and small. I rarely talk about myself either, just enough to get by. I play it safe. 

I’ve always just felt like there was something wrong with me. Social anxiety kinda describes the way I feel but it seems like it’s more than just that.",3
2924,"My mom has Avoidant and dependent personality disorder and I don't know what to do. My mom is a very caring and emotional person and she's never been mean or rude in any way.  However, she never believes me when I say that to her. She's struggling with loving herself and believes that no one loves her and can help her. And because of that she has resorted to drinking. 
Because of her disorders, she constantly bullies herself every day on everything she does and thinks she's the worst person alive. She's very sensitive too, so one little thing can ruin her day and cause her to drink. 

My parents are separated but they’re both on good terms and still talk.  
On top of that, I’m struggling with myself too and I think I’m stressing her out. I'm only 14 so what can I do to help her? She tried many antidepressants and other treatments but said that none works. Compliments doesn’t work either since she never believes me.

2926,"It's getting bad again Weird how spring is approaching quickly, yet I can feel the darkness coming again. In the mornings, I wake up as late as possible, so I can spend the early hours in my bed, either unconscious or dreaming, without pain-- without the burden of reality.

The rest of the day I spend in a haze of hating myself, escaping reality through videogames, and starving myself. Losing weight makes me feel good again: I deserve the feeling of an empty stomach, and at the same time, restricting my calories is the only thing that I can control in my life. 

These days, I'm very forgetful, too. I forget appointments and run late for the very few things I have left in my life. My family gets angry at me a lot, to them I am a nuisance. They don't understand why I am slacking. They don't know that I hate being alive, and their anger makes me want to end my consciousness even more.

The evenings are the worst, though, because they are filled with regrets. I'm wasting time. I'm ruining my 20s. I'm isolating myself from the world and soon I won't have anyone left. But I cannot change. I'm powerless against the sadness. It doesn't feel like spring.",1

Any time I was left with a house to myself I would get mates to come over and stay or I would go out. Its only at night when I have to go to bed in the house that I have the issue, I otherwise tend to enjoy being by myself. 

This whole thing is filling me with more and more anxiety. I know i'm building it up alot but its been one childhood fear never managed to sort out.

And now it seems so obvious he was just messing with me, cuz he didn’t answer like half of my texts till days later and never actually asked me anything about myself. But I made excuses because I thought I was being like clingy and not understanding how relationships work. But no if a guy likes you he’s gonna show interest and actually answer your texts…

2933,"Looking for different ways to cope with stress? I’ve been scrolling this subreddit looking for ways to deal with stress. I’m a 22 year old college student. This past year I have completely shut myself out from the world (not literally), but mentally.

My mother was incarcerated recently. Her and her husband kicked my 18 year-old brother out (still don’t know why). My dad and I have a rocky relationship. With all of that, I’m a full-time student and looking for another job. With that being said, those events have taken a toll on me mentally. I feel so drained and emotionally overwhelmed. It’s started taking a toll on me physically. I don’t eat that often, have stopped exercise, barely leave the house, and quit my job. I don’t even remember the last time I got a good night rest (sleep without tossing and turning every hour). It’s been months. I feel so terrible. You can just look at me and tell i’m not myself.

2934,"Stressing about Studying I am in my mid 30s and have just been given the chance to do an extra year and a half of study in a different University. The degree that I have was more theory based and I really need hands on experience to be employable in my field, which I now have the opportunity to do alongside guaranteed internships and portfolio work. 

My stress levels are currently through the roof about this, as I am worried that I won't be able to match the calibre of current high school leavers, who, even though treated as adults at University, still seem to have that high school mentality. My main issue is, even though not permanent, the dorm style accommodation and the fact that an ""old"" person is living with basically a teenager, although I did apply for a single room with a shared bathroom, so maybe not so bad. 

Usually I wouldn't have a problem with this, but already having experienced this with not much success, I am now stressing immensely. I'm not there to be anybody's friend, but the way I have been treated in the past, just for being a little older has been disgusting. There is not much available accommodation at all in the country, so looking for anything else is currently out.

Honestly, I think I'm just stressing because I'm over 30 and feel like I still don't have my life in order, with another future gap in my resume.

2970,"Should I see my doctor? I'm new here, not diagnosed with any type of stress disorder.

Long story short; I'm a 26 y/o female, in a happy relationship, enjoy my studies at uni and my student job. I have friends (not a lot, but I'm an introvert so that fits me) and a loving family. At the same time I have a few diagnosis - an eating disorder, OCD and borderline personality disorder. All of them something I've gotten treatment for, and I have under control.

The reason for this post is new. Since my summer vacation ended a month ago, I've had this problem. Every time I sit down to do some studying I start crying. I can't concentrate and the more time passes, the farther behind I get. I have a hard time getting started with any task - studying, cleaning, getting to classes, being intimate with my partner, anything. Just writing these few lines have taking me half an hour to start, half an hour to write.

My question for you guys is; Should I see my doctor about this? Or is this just a part of life, and not even a real problem? I don't feel like talking to the people around me about this, I don't want to worry   them if I just need to get myself together...

So, my therapist has suggested that I read Choice Theory by William Glasser... I used a credit on audible to get it, it is a little over 12 hours long... I haven't started it yet, but what I have read about choice theory tells me I will disagree with a main premise, which my therapist and I kinda got into today...

He insists that thoughts and emotions are choices. Going so far as to say that mental illness is a choice. In regards to bipolar, if you are not having negative consequences, do you have bipolar? Because you can choose your actions and reactions and emotions and thoughts.

That medicine is a crutch and is not necessary.

He says that this gives you the power to control your life and swings and even get rid of swings.

This came up when I was asking about tools because my regular tool for dealing with intrusive thoughts isn't really cutting it for me right now (having the thought, then saying to myself, is this thought beneficial/useful/helpful to me?)

There are several things here that I am in complete disagreement with. Medicine is necessary, thoughts and emotions are not controllable (i.e. they just happen, but can potentially be directed) and, mental illness is real and not a choice.

Sure you can do things to help mitigate symptoms and try and improve yourself, but ~~I am pretty sure~~ I will always have bipolar. He has planted a seed of doubt.

I am writing this note with a heavy heart, seeking and begging for your forgiveness for my pathetic and weak existence. I am sorry for the pain and disappointment I may have caused you all through my cowardly acts and weak display of character.

My entire life has been a complete failure; I have been consumed by fear, self-doubt, and discouragement that it has rendered me powerless in almost all aspects of my life. I have tried so hard to fit in and be accepted, but it seems like no matter how much I try, my efforts are always not good enough.

I am sorry for all the times I let you down, for all the opportunities I squandered and wasted because I was too timid to seize the moment. I am sorry for all the people whose trust and love I lost because I could not face my shortcomings.

I know that taking my own life is not the solution, but I cannot bear the pain and the emptiness that I feel inside anymore. I cannot bear living in this world that expects too much from me when I clearly cannot deliver.

I hope that one day you can find it in your hearts to forgive me for my cowardice and inadequacy. I hope that you can move past my shortcomings and failures and remember me for the good that I once was.

To my family, friends and loved ones, I am sorry that I couldn't be the strong and dependable person that you deserved. I hope that my death brings you some form of closure and relief from the burden that I have become in your lives.

I will leave this world with a prayer in my heart that one day the world will be a better place where acceptance, kindness, and love abound, may nobody else ever feel the isolation and pain that I have felt during my life.

I hope that when I am gone, the world becomes brighter and filled with more hope and happiness. Goodbye, world. Please forgive me.

Yours sincerely,

3007,"Feeling dreadful after best friend didn't want me to come on night I know this feeling is unjust, but I can't help but feeling dreadfully anxious and sad that my best friend didn't want me at a night on the Weekend. 

I'd been excluded before in this group of friends when they went on holiday last year together. I was really upset then and just so happened to be very down at that time anyway so I ended up bringing it up and we got into a huge fight where he said he hadn't meant to and these things just happened, but also, I needed to back off.

So this weekend, he said he'd got a ticket for this night but downplayed it like it was only him and another guy and not the whole group going. But everyone from that group went. He said he hadn't known they were but I'm sure that's not true and now on reflection, they had probably planned it for months. 

I know I have no right feeling this way, people can do what they want but I can't help but feeling really sad about it, like he didn't want me there for a reason and after last time, I don't want to mention anything because I don't think he'd take it well. I know we should be able to do different things, and I'm not saying otherwise but I know everyone in this group and wonder why he didn't want me there. It's making me feel pretty low.

3009,"I think my brother is depressed and I'm unsure what to do. Any advice or suggestions on what I should do? He's 19, dropped out of college because he have no passion in anything. He hates learning and have no friends. He's always in his room and refuse to leave. He would lock his door and turn off the lights. When my parents asked him if he wants to go somewhere he just screamed no repeatedly at them. Sometimes when we come back home and I check up on him, he told me he regretted it and said he's a horrible person.

I suggested him to get professional help. I'm also seeing a therapist to try to better myself. But my brother told me it's a waste of time and he doesn't want to talk about his feelings. All he does is play pc games from morning to night. Even till 3 am. My mom comes home from her night shift and when she saw that he's still awake they started a screaming match. Their loud voices would wake me up and I try to stop them and it never works.

Now I just check up on him and try to have a decent conversation with him. I would talk about video games with him or other things he's interested. But most of the time he yells at me to leave his room.

I think he has a lot of pressure from my mom. She wants him to go to college in the medical or engineer field. It might be partially my fault too. My mom wanted me to be a nurse but I got a degree in art. Even my relatives told me ""you can't have 2 siblings in the creative field. There has to be a balance. Your brother should be in stem."" I asked my brother and he actually wants to be a writer. I feel bad, I don't think I'm a good older sister (I'm 25). I focused on my own issues for a long time now. I also tried defending him against my family but he told me to stop. My brother ended up yelling at me that I'm a failure because it took me 6 years to graduate, got a useless degree and tons of job rejections.

3012,"Expressing myself I feel like I’ve had a realization in the last few months that I wanted to share. It’s that one of the ways forward with this disability for me is to learn how to honestly express myself without distortion, and to do that constantly without regard for the fact that it causes me pain and discomfort.

 I used to cope with my issues by putting on a mask of a personality that I built using self help books and a desperate need for approval. Basically just the ‘fake it til you make it strategy’. Although I became more conventionally likable, it truly did not help in the long run as I was never able to get close to people. Now I am back to an ultimately isolated life. But I’m trying something different.

It’s very challenging to me and not always doable but I think it is necessary. And that is to view socializing as a simple and honest expression of myself between others. When I have a thought or opinion or feeling, say it, put it out there in some way (for better or worse). Also, treat what others say as true expression of their being. This may sound silly but I think it is a subtle seeming thing that is actually big deal.

As I said it’s challenging and not always doable, this is because 
1. A deeply negative emotional and sometimes physical reaction to the idea of expressing most things in my mind for fear of embarrassment or rejection.
2. My brain going blank due to weariness and therefor not having anything to express.
3. The fact that isolation makes me depressed and lonely so the things on my mind can bring the vibe down.

But regardless I realize that this is what I have to do, and that watching myself mindfully and purely expressing what’s on my mind is the only way forward. Usually what happens when I force something out is that I brace for impact. Brace for embarrassment, rejection, etc. Usually I assume that people are secretly embarrassed for me for whatever I said, but whether or not that is true isn’t important.

I’ve been trying a lot of tools of expression such as music, writing, and drawing, and I think these are helping me learn how to express myself naturally.

Anyway, I’m tired of pretending. Im not sure if I will ever be able to speak without fear and shame, but at least I won’t have to strain myself into a ‘safe’ caricature. Maybe this seems like crazy person thoughts but I hope someone relates or understands.",3

3017,"Dealing with the Critics in Your Life Whatever you’re trying to achieve - save the world, write a novel, devote yourself to a particular cause – there are likely to be those who will be critical. Some people just have a critical disposition while others will take issue with the specifics of your particular endeavour. Criticism is unavoidable. Your choice is in how to respond to it. 

### Consider these strategies for managing the critics in your life:

**Clarify your purpose.** As humans, we are compelled to make meaning. Making meaning for ourselves – and value for others – is fundamental to a life well lived. When you’re doing something very important to you, you care far less about the criticisms of others. If they can easily throw you off your path, you might want to reflect on how important it really is to you. Are you living your purpose consistent with you values?

**Understand the critic’s motivation.** Are they projecting themselves in to the situation – their aspirations, their skill set, their propensity for risk, their values? Are they genuinely trying to protect you from any potential down-sides? Are they trying to maintain the status quo – for you, them or both? Are they masking their own lack of action? 

**Recognise that criticism is not balanced appraisal.** We have evolved to notice negative issues more readily than positive ones. We are more likely to notice criticism than encouragement: people working against us over people supporting us. Most people are actually indifferent to you and your life so get on and live it.

**Realize that you’re going to be criticized no matter what you do.** Whether you become a billionaire, movie star, teacher, doctor, or sit on the couch all day, there is someone that will tell you that you’re doing the wrong thing. So, live your life building towards what you do want rather than what the critics don’t want.

**Respond calmly.** Rather than giving your critics the pleasure of an emotional response, respond kindly with a considered response. Acknowledge any leaps of faith you are making. 

**Use your critics as motivation.** While some people are intimidated and deflated by the critics of the world, others are able to use the negative comments as a source of motivation. Remind yourself that while the critics are standing on the sidelines, you are on the pitch and playing the game.

**Decide if they have something useful to say.** Some criticism may carry valid points – explore these with your critic and ask what their solution would be – the response differentiates between useful and harmful dialogue. If the criticism isn’t useful, move on. You have more important things to do.

**Take criticism as a compliment.** Most people will leave you alone if you’re struggling or aren’t doing anything noteworthy. You only become a significant target of negative comments if you’re doing well. If you’re taking a lot of heat, you must be doing something correct!

**Live your life without the need for the approval of others.** Live your own life, by your own values. Use your signature strengths to create meaning for you, value for others and legacy for the future in your chosen pursuit. 

I hope you took something useful from this piece; I have posted a further series of quick reads on my own little corner of Reddit – would be great to see you there.",0
3018,"Things are about to be bad I’m 22 and graduating college soon.  My fiancé is somewhat physically disabled and I will be supporting her financially upon graduation.  NGL, she’s an emotional wreck right now with chronic insomnia, attachment anxiety, severe severe mood swings, anger issues, general anxiety, body dysmorphia, and depression just off the top of my head right now.  I love her to death but it’s hard to be with her.  Despite this, We are both very happy in our relationship.  She makes me very happy and I love spending time with her.  I’ve been cooking and cleaning for the both of us every day and doing my college work.  It’s ok now,  but in few months I’m starting my job in finance, and although the compensation is fantastic, i will likely work ~60-70 hours a week which is already considered low for my field.  I need to work this job for my career objectives but also to provide for my fiancé financially, pay her medical bills, and have enough left over to live comfortably.

I stress over not being home enough to support my fiancé emotionally.  Her depressive episodes are severe as it is.  Will she sink into further depression and isolation because I’ll be at work?  What happens when I get home at on my 70 hour work weeks and I don’t have the energy to calm her anxiety at night?

I stress over not being able to work the grueling hours needed to succeed in my position.  If I do not, I can’t make our rent, pay her medical bills, buy food for us, and be a provider.  

I can’t actually tell her any of this either, it will absolutely devastate her to know that she is causing me so much mental stress.  I know it will worsen her anxiety too.  Maybe I will when she is in better mental health.


I’m not a picture of mental health either.  I was an alcoholic at 14 and a smoker at 15.  I was bullied and rejected up till I came to college and got my shit together somewhat. Luckily that’s behind me now…What if I’m to weak to function well in my job?  Then I’ll get fired, we’ll get evicted, my fiancé will suffer greatly, and I’ll be jobless.

3022,"Feeling pretty stressed about this 


I (M20) have a crush on this girl at the drama club at the community college I go to. We met about a month ago. I did ask her if she wants to get some dinner sometime, but she said she isn’t looking for a relationship right now, but if it happens, it’s fine. (I told her that we’ll go as friends, but of course that was a lie).

Today, we took down all of the sets from the show we did. A group of friends were talking to me and one of them said that I can ask her if she wants to go bowling. However, me and her don’t have any classes together, so I’m gonna have to ask her over text since I forgot to ask her earlier today.

What should I do about this? This is actually the first crush I had where I actually feel comfortable with her. (Meaning, making good eye contact and all that).",0

I'm about to get the opportunity to go on an all-expenses paid (totally free) one week trip to the Netherlands with colleagues. But I'm afraid to go in case anxiety takes over me being away from home.

Almost two years ago I had my first bout of anxiety for no apparent reason. One day it came and took hold of me and I spent more than a month in a daze without being able to leave the house or walk down the street...

Hopefully I managed to ""get over it"", but I feel that this period/stage marked my life as always. Now I live in fear and things that I liked to do before I have stopped doing or I don't do them for fear that it will make me anxious.

Among them, I always planned to travel as much as possible with family and friends the day I had a stable job and recurring income. Well, now I am in that situation but I do it for fear of getting anxiety outside the house, not being able to control it and the situation exploding.

I still remember the panic attacks I used to get for no reason (I had no reason to) and I shudder.... It was the worst situation and time of my life. I feel that it has marked me forever.

3063,"Psychiatrist or psychologist? (F,22) TW: self harm, suicide


Hey there! I hope this is the right place to post about this. I don't know anyone irl who deals with so much anxiety so here we go.

Since last summer I've been dealing with a lot of intrusive/obsessive thoughts about my relationship/my partner/me etc which caused a lot of anxiety. From july all the way through december I felt like I was going crazy. I felt so much anxiety and so much emotional pain to the point where I thought I couldn't function properly. I would've done anything to stop feeling anything at all. And everything between me and my partner was fine, I didn't have any reason to feel like this.

In january I started to feel a bit better (anxiety wise), but I started to self harm again (I don't do this constantly, only once or twice every few months I guess). In january and february I felt so sad and so numb that I didn't care about anything anymore. I think I also experience suicidal thoughts but I am very afraid to die so idk if I actually do experience them. I still feel a little bit anxious and I do experience self harm thoughts here and there but overall I can function decently. 

I've never been to a psychiatrist or psychologist and so idk where I should start. The thing is, therapy is very expensive and I can't afford it right now. I could afford going to a psychiatrist tho, but i don't know if my situation is that bad in order to reach out to a psychiatrist. I am scared they won't take me seriously and that they will tell me to go to therapy instead.

Do you have any advice regarding my situation? Any response would be much appreciated.",4
3064,"I find it so frustrating as a highly anxious and depressed person to do career tests because they rely on your passion for specific activities and I find myself answering ""I dislike it very much"" to the various questions (e.g,. working in construction, healthcare, finance, whatever). I've been trying to get back to work again because it seems my severe depression and anxiety won't go away and there is only so much medication and therapy can help me. Of course, I haven't tried every kind of therapy but what had been offered to me at low cost. But I've tried many medications.

Anyhow, I feel very frustrated because after trying couple of online part time jobs (like writing marketing stuff on websites) and finding myself not motivated enough to work sufficient hours to make ends meet, I'm trying to start from zero again and do some career tests to find what motivates me. But those tests don't offer some magical information but just rely on what you're passionate about. Like they give you 50 questions and ask you how much you like doing different activities, like installing cabinets, diagnosing disease in people, giving financial advice to someone wanting to get a loan, helping a disabled person get dressed, playing a musical instrument in front of an audience, taking care of sick animals, etc etc etc.

I hate them ALL! None of these activities excite me. Because having a job is always about what others expect of you. But mental illness sucks so much of your energy that there is so little left for the job.

Like if I'm a cashier, my high anxiety and depression and the various thoughts and emotions and physical symptoms I experience will take so much of my energy to control and nothing left to put on a smile and make a customer feel welcome and at the same time do my job of scanning items very quickly and correctly.

That's why I've been trying to find jobs that are just online and things I can do on my own time, so that whenever the damned mental health issues give me a break then I can do the job. The problem is there are too many people doing these jobs and they pay so little that I've had to start looking at other options.

Also i dont Feel hunger. And never sleepy in my head. I also dont Feel confused in my head or get a foggy feeling. Even though i know that is what i am. 

I also never get a feeling associated with a place or memory. When i think of a memory i get no spontanious emotion connected to it. 

Like sitting on the terrace with a nice cup of tee, early morning walks, sitting down on the couch after a hard day of work. Never get these feelings in my body. Also the feelifn of autimn, friday, christmas. All gone. Cant even remember them in my mind because i cant Feel with my brain.

3104,"Possibly losing parenting rights due to bipolar disorder The most recent manic episode I had was after being depressed and diagnosed with major depressive disorder to be prescribed Zoloft. Within 6 weeks I was staying up for 9 days and delusional. I thought my partner was going to kill me so I called 911. The police arrived and I was very agitated and explained my delusions and they took me to the nearest psych ward for an evaluation. Unfortunately, that psych ward didn’t keep me long enough despite my volunteering to stay longer. They also gave me a medication I ended up allergic to which took treatment even longer.

This resulted in asking my in-laws who live in a different state miles away to help me care for my daughter until I found the right medication combination and was stable. I knew it could take a few months and I had no one else available local to me. The only way my inlaws would take my daughter is if I signed over guardianship. I was under the impression it would only be for a year at the most. But honestly, I wasn’t really in the right mind to consent to that paperwork. I just knew I needed help and I did what I could to ensure my daughter had the best care possible while I got stable. 

Fast forward to now my partner and I petitioned the courts to end guardianship as I have been stable for 2 years. I have letters from my therapist and pdoc stating I am in treatment and stable and medication compliant. 

Well, my in-laws are trying to prove I am unfit for things I did while I was manic so they can adopt my daughter without my consent or permission through the courts. They're also trying to prove that my partner (their child) is unfit I am less worried about that. 

My therapist says they're on a witch hunt and that they're just trying to raddle me and no judge would grant them adoption. I hope she's right.

3112,"Travel Tips? How do you handle barking security agents, boarding passes, changing itinerary, foreign languages, rude locals, etc. without losing it? Here's what's worked for me:

Photograph \*everything\* important - passports, credit cards, boarding passes, luggage, and store the photos in a locked folder on your phone. This helps recovery of lost items, lower your footprint if you get robbed, and it creates backups because you never know.

Try to research as much ahead of time - Rick Steves advises to book the important stuff, but keep things open ended. I've found, since I'm so easily distracted, to have a few good options at all times that you can do in case things are getting weird. 

Go easy on the coffee - first thing I want to do in an airport or a new city is to have coffee. There's downtime, I'm jetlagged, weary, and already overstimulated, and caffeine I think adds to my disorganization. If I get lost, it makes me look even more like a crackhead asking for directions. It's best to get acclimated then act like a local.

Assume you will get lost and account for it - my sense of directions are terrible. Without google maps, I would be at the front of Walmart, aged progressed, with a slightly insulting cash reward for whoever finds me. Set up SIM cards, initial itinerary, and a basic plan to get settled after arrival. 

Breathe, dammit! - everything's new, everything's stimulating, but you have responsibilities. Stay present and take.your.meds. Do you really want to be hospitalized overseas?

3116,"I’m worried I’m second choice I met a guy on a trip two years ago. He told mutual friends that he liked me, and he asked them not to tell me, but they did. When he found out that I knew, he cut off all contact with me. Two months later, he and his girlfriend broke up. I have to admit that before he was single, I'd look at his TikToks a lot. I never liked or commented on it; I'd just watch the videos.

A few days before he and his girlfriend broke up, I noticed that my TikToks would go up. I had 3 followers, but whenever I'd watch his videos, a few hours later, my TikTok views would rise. I even tried doing it on certain days; eg. I'd watch his videos one day, watch it two days later, then the day after, and each time I saw them, my views went up, and on the days that I didn't watch them, they stayed the same. This continued for the better part of a year. Last year, it was still frequent, but less so. Now, it's every two or three weeks that we do this. One time, he even posted a TikTok in English (English isn't his first language, and all of his previous videos were in his native language).

TikTok wasn't the only platform he was looking at me on. He would do it on Twitter too. One time, I retweeted a picture of a Star Wars character. Less than an hour later, he posted a meme of that same character. The meme was in English, and it's not that I want to say that the meme wasn't funny, but it was obvious that he posted it just to post it. There's been at least three other instances where he did something similar.

However, twice he did things that tickled me funny. About six months after they broke up, he started following her on TikTok, but unfollowed her within a few hours (probably because she didn’t follow him back). A month later, one of his ex's close friends posted a TikTok video with his ex in it. He started following this friend. Around eight months of this going on, he made his Instagram and TikTok private. I have no idea why. But I can tell he still looks at my TikTok, because TikTok tells who looks at your profile. I don’t post much, and he looks at it every two to three days.",3

3118,"Anxiety med. that's not an antidepressant? Hello! 

I have always been anxious, and as of 2-3 years ago, I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder. I've been in therapy for years and tried all sorts of medications (Lexapro, Zoloft, medical marijuana, CBD, Valium, Klonopin, Xanax, Amitriptyline), and the only thing that worked were the benzos. I'm extremely lucky to have an NP who fills my Xanax refills. The problem is... I don't want to be addicted to this medication. I take it very sparingly, which is why it works so well, but I only take these when I feel nauseous/jittery/panicky, which, fortunately, is not 24/7. However, I do have GAD pretty bad. In the shower, thoughts just race and I can't find the ""off"" switch. It's ruined my sleep. It's taken a dump on my memory. I just cannot live like this anymore. 

Meditations help in the moment I do them, but I feel like I need to be medicated. I was on Zoloft for about 6 months, and it helped tremendously, but when I tried getting back on it (I properly titrated my dose when I get off them), for some reason the side effects were extremely unbearable. Granted, I started back at 50mg, when before I was on it for 25mg for a week and then 50mg the second week and continued for 4-6 weeks. It could also be that at the time I could tolerate medical marijuana, but now, that makes me either anxious/jittery or straight-up nauseous. 

Lexapro? Forget it. I started at 10mg, and that was a nightmare. I was so nauseous by day 2, if it wasn't for my anti-nausea med, I would've projectile vomitted all over my kitchen floor. The other time I was at 5mg, and I felt so cracked out. 

I also don't like that SSRIs are rough on my body for 4-6 weeks. Maybe that's just the gamble you take, but I hate having increased anxiety, inability to ejaculate, and horrendous stomach pains for a month. Does that sound like fun to anyone? 

I took amitriptyline, and that was more for chronic pain, and it barely did anything, and as for anxiety, I didn't notice much of a difference either, and I tried this medication at 10 and 25mg.

I have an appointment with my NP tomorrow, and she is well aware I struggle with anxiety. Is there a medication that's not an antidepressant that works for GAD and is not a benzo, meaning I can take as often as needed? 

I've also tried supplements like L-Theanine, Melatonin, and Ashwagandha, and they don't do crap.

Yeah, withdrawals and discontinuation syndromes suck. But discouraging people from taking medication X that his doc prescribed now he's scared to take it is immoral.

You had this experience, fine, doesn't mean he will. I saw a post on someone taking clonazepam for years on 6 mgs a day.

He stupidly cold-turkey'd one day and even months later he had no withdrawals. Other's might have lethal seizures.

It's very annoying to see a question about medication X and then tons of comments practically tell him not to take it because of withdrawals. 

Withdrawals are normal, so are discontinuation syndromes. You must go through it for 1 - 2 weeks, yes, very uncomfortable. I also suffered it. But this is not a reason to discourage someone to take the medication he was prescribed for his illness.

Not to mention, he is not you. He/She might not experience the same things you did.

The side-effects are too much for me to accept (weight gain, akathisia, and my least favourite, emotional blunting/stifling creativity). 

I’m schizoaffective bipolar subtype and realize I need meds to function, but sometimes it feels like a losing battle to find a combo that works — *for me*. 

I’m on 750mg of lithium and 20mg olanzapine right now (because it “works”). 

Is it about accepting the downsides of meds and just living as stably as possible?",2

I also was also very recently diagnosed with C-PTSD due to an abusive childhood. I had a partner that I absolutely adored but after a huge life stressor I started to experience psychosis and paranoia and broke up with him because I strongly believed he was plotting against me and planning to hurt me. I then went through a series of depressive and manic episodes following the break up. When I finally got stabilized I reached out to him hoping to rekindle only to find out he had moved on with a girl who probably isn’t a complete psycho like I am. I wasn’t as good a girlfriend as I could’ve been either because of my unstable moods and lack of energy/ basic life skills/ girlfriend experience, I wish I could do it all over again and just really show him how much I loved him. It just tears me up inside, I miss him so much, I’m sure he hates my guts. It honestly makes me want to stop living because I miss him so much. I don’t think I’ll ever find anyone else who can handle my craziness. I’m unlovable :(",2

She is in a different state right now though where as I am across the ocean, so a heavy time difference. Cant really talk to her because of this. In the next while, my work (military related) will be conducting 24 hr ops so I will be working at least 12 hour shifts. Found out I have to wait to advance my career this week, got ghosted when trying to buy a car, and lost 75% of the sleep I need to function. I’ve been functioning on 2 to 4 hours most days. Oh and, work was extra crazy in prep for me this week aswell.

That’s aside from the regular person stress ofc.

I need more sleep and to “chillax” but in a weird twisted way, this has been an extremely entertaining week for me.

Any advice or ideas would be much appreciated however

Western medicine is bullshit and so is therapy apparently.

We also recently just moved countries and it's a new start and everything so idk, if that's maybe what's causing this. But because of stress I've been experiencing MAJOR hair loss, like i mean I shed like HUGE clumps of hair at a time, and it happens throughout the day. And when i take a head shower, the whole drain is basically filled with like so much hair i could make a wig out of it, LITERALLY I'm not kidding or lying. And ik some people will say it's just hair and everything, but i luv taking care of it, and the health of my hair is kind of very important to me, so it stresses me out even more thinking abt it. And I've tried multiple hair products and everything, but no product seems to be helping. Is anyone experiencing this too? Or has anyone experienced this before? If so could u pls tell me what u did or any tips and advice, cuz i really really do need it.

she mentioned having extra tickets, but i'm still buying my own because she didn't directly offer it to me, and i don't want to embarrass myself in case it's not implied. they're like 15$ each so it's not outlandish or anything. and i'm too afraid to ask to clarify like ""so if i'm going too would you give me one of your extra tickets?"" it's not unreasonable i know- if i were her i wouldn't mind the question but i'd feel like a terrible person for asking even if we were closer. also not going to clarify that this is 100% platonic because we're coworkers and i *think* she knows i'm gay (the one thing i miss about presenting female is that i never had to make those distinctions with other girls). but will live in fear of that misunderstanding nonetheless. 

another fear: evilyn is on pretty friendly terms with ""jonah"" (20M) our other coworker, a the one and only person ive ever romantically pursued (lots to unpack with that but for brevity's sake, let's not.) as in, they've hung out outside of work more than once. now, i don't think jonah is the petty type, but if evilyn mentions it to him i wouldn't put it past him to say something (idk what but not sure he likes me much at the moment) that would make her back out. and if that were the case she'd just make an excuse so i would never really know. 

rambling post, but i wanted to talk about my fears somewhere. this is the closest i will get to feeling hyped about hanging out with someone. 

mainly- in my own head i have to ""earn"" outings by going over everything that could go wrong and by being of use- ie giving her a ride without expecting a free ticket. yeeeah it's a lot. thanks for reading all 🖤",3

3263,"Are You an Introvert with Anxiety? Anxiety. That emotion warning us something threatening is just about to happen. Life-saving when we are genuinely threatened, damaging when we become constantly anxious: anxiety is tiring – it is meant to be. We are only meant to be anxious for very short periods. When prolonged, it isn’t just tiring – it is exhausting. Sound familiar? 

Introverts. Those of us who prefer calm situations and environments. We prefer to re-charge on our own. We often enjoy losing ourselves in our own thoughts. We tend to have small, close-knit, social lives it doesn’t mean we’re anti-social!

Not all introverts experience anxiety, and you don’t have to be an introvert to struggle with it. Many introverts deal with anxiety, though, so this is quite common.

Here are the key signs you’re an introvert with anxiety:

· You’re more prepared than most others because you’ve already thought through the worst-case scenarios.

· You have a tendency to over-think things and pay too much attention to your negative self-talk.

· You feel you always have to be doing something – being busy (which is often different from being effective) may be a means of trying to cope with the anxiety.

· You tend to prefer routines to novel situations. While this can be fine for periods, boredom and unexpected issues arising can easily throw you in to a spin.

· You’re often nervous without showing it – many become very effective at masking their emotions as a defence mechanism. 

· You are more likely to perceive situations as being more dangerous than they really are - anxiety primes us for the fight, flight, freeze response making us more likely to over-react to a low-risk situation.

· You have tendencies towards perfectionism. This is often allied to beliefs such as ‘I need to please everyone’, ‘I need everyone to like me to be a worthy person’.

· Nervousness can throw your chatter in to over-drive: while you normally only speak when you have something significant to say (and you’re normally sure of your facts before speaking), nerves can have you chattering away in an attempt to over-compensate.

· You often have trouble sleeping – either getting to sleep a-tall, waking through the night or waking way too early 

Being an introvert with anxiety can be hard. Thankfully there is help at hand. Anxiety in its many guises is one of the most common issues Solution Focused Hypnotherapy therapists helps people with.

One of the best ways to decrease how much total stress you experience is by adding good forms of stress (short and moderate) called hormetic stressors.  Cold water is a prototypical hormetic stressor.  It releases stress hormones like adrenaline and noradrenaline but it is short and not extreme.   

We just launched an app that provides guided cold showers to make it easy for you to do them.  It is led by a Master Chief Navy SEAL.  We teach you a set of mental tools around tactical breathwort, body relaxation, self talk, etc.  These tools not only make cold showers easier but they also help you handle stress more generally.    

In fact, the best way to train yourself to handle stress better is to systematically stress yourself and then practice these tools while stressed.  If you do that, these tools will become reflexive any time your body generates stress hormones.

3316,"Dr. Seuss Style Bipolar Story Once in the land of Whippety-Woo,
Where the Squibberpops squibbered, and the Flobberjops flew,
A creature named Zeebie lived high in a tree,
Where it twisted and twined in a squiggly spree.

Now Zeebie was special, you see, my dear friend,
For the way he would feel seemed to twist and to bend.
Sometimes Zeebie would zip and would zoom,
Like a rocket ship blasting straight past the moon!

""I'm on top of the world!"" he'd exclaim with great cheer,
Bouncing high on the clouds, without any fear.
He'd giggle and wiggle and dance all day long,
Singing sweet Zeebie songs in a voice loud and strong.

But there were days when Zeebie felt quite the opposite,
His energy vanished, as if swallowed by a Glopit.
He'd mope and he'd grope for the light in the dark,
His once-sparkling eyes now a mere flickering spark.

The creatures of Whippety-Woo began to see,
That Zeebie's behavior was not as it should be.
They'd all gather 'round, full of worry and care,
But their words couldn't lift him from his deepest despair.

One day, as Zeebie lay down in the shade,
A wise Flippety-Flop hopped along and displayed,
A great book of wisdom, with secrets so grand,
It could help Zeebie balance and finally understand.

""You see, my dear Zeebie,"" the Flippety-Flop said,
""It seems that your feelings are not in your head.
A thing called Bipolar has made you this way,
But I'm here to help, so please don't dismay!""

The Flippety-Flop opened the book with a grin,
And as they read, Zeebie's eyes widened within.
He learned of the ups, of the downs, and the swings,
And how he could manage these challenging things.

""Take time for yourself, dear Zeebie,"" it said,
""Find comfort in quiet, and rest your sweet head.
When you're feeling quite high, try to harness your glee,
And channel your energy through art, dance, or a spree.""

""And when you're feeling quite low, in a pit of despair,
Please remember, dear Zeebie, that we'll all still be there.
Reach out to a friend or a Whippety-Woo,
For they'll help you get through, and they'll see you pull through.""

As Zeebie absorbed these new lessons so wise,
He wiped away tears that welled up in his eyes.
The Flippety-Flop smiled and patted his back,
Then hopped off into the sunset, his bag tightly packed.

With new tools in hand, Zeebie set out to try,
To find balance and peace beneath the bright sky.
He'd still have his ups, and he'd still have his downs,
But he knew that his friends in the Whippety-Woo town, Would always stand by him, through thick and through thin, No matter how high or how low he'd begin.
For Zeebie was loved, and he'd always be so,
A creature with feelings, and a heart that would grow.

So remember, dear reader, this story so true,
When life gets you down, or your feelings construe.
There's always a way to find balance and peace,
In a world full of love, where friendships won't cease.

I am 22 yo and I've been studying to become a lawyer for the past 6 years.

I'm on the verge of finishing my studies and I ask myself: what's the point?

How are we supposed to keep living as if things were normal, as if Society was not rushing towards a brick wall?

I've been worried about the environment for years, especially feeling helpless and seeing governments and multinationals not giving a damn.

In order not to be crushed with worry, I held onto the idea that, at worse, our generation would be okay and it's the next one which would suffer the big consequences.

In reality, it's hard to be that optimistic, especially as IPCC reports get more serious and worrying every time they're issued.

The idea that Society is on the verge of collapse feels more realistic as time goes by. I'm scared that it will not be able to adapt to climate change, that we will die or live in a post-apocalyptic world.

I'm scared and I feel helpless, especially as a future lawyer because I don't see the use in lawyers in such a situation. I'm feeling depressed because I feel like my studies are pointless. I don't see how lawyers can be useful to save the world. 

I feel like it's too late for lawyers to be helpful in urgent times, as law is such a slow process. I feel like what we need are people in the field; scientists, real politicians, essential jobs, etc.

What the hell is the oppression Olympics between AvPD and SzPD all about with some people on this sub? 

There are all these casual mentions of things like “well my life sucks but at least I’m happy I don’t have SzPD” that keep showing up lately.

Why not just say something about being relieved not having to experience **social anhedonia**? It’s not the only symptom experienced by people with SzPD, although it seems to be simplified into that.

I don’t understand the obsessive need of some of the people in this sub to glorify that they are somehow winning against other mental ill people simply because they don’t experience social anhedonia.

Experiencing social anhedonia is not a intentional choice of people with Schizoid PD. It would be like saying people with ADHD are choosing to be inattentive.

Also, there is a lot more to SzPD then the one symptom that some people in this sub seem to be hyperfixating on.

3358,"Everytime I think of my ""future"" I just think, ""Maybe I should kms."" because it would be so much easier and so much less painful to just kms now than it would be to struggle to just survive. I listen to my cousin and siblings...they all have their life mapped out and planned. For me, I was planning on not having a future, so I never actually made a road map to success for my life. Sometimes I wonder if it's as obvious to see that as I do.

For the longest time, I thought I would d1e before age 18, so I put off thinking about what I'd do after school. Then when I hit 18 and was still alive I just did the bare minimum to stay afloat, I kept biding my time like that hoping I'd have a spontaneous heart attack or something because of how unhealthily I treat my body.

But yet I'm still here ... why? 

How come hundreds of thousands of people who wanted to live died at an early age, but I who want to die am still here when I've not taken care of myself in so long... why, why, why?

I don't understand why the world is doing this to me. Even though my thoughts of death have been pretty passive, it's not like they don't affect me at all. Everytime I get my tiny paycheck and see that I don't have enough to afford more than 1 meal a day I just want to die more. All I asked for was a job that I don't hate, that pays me a wage to live on my own...back in my parents day it seemed like that was actually doable relatively easily from the stories they both tell. Why is that not the case anymore? Or is it just me?

Again I ask, if the world wants me to live so much, than why make it so goddamn hard to actually live??? 

I'm so fcking tired of living. Nothing here is worth it. I hate this fcking world. I hate every single person on this planet. I hate my stupid job. Hate my stupid boss. I hate how everything revolves around money. I hate the society humans created. I hate myself for not just being born a normal person.

Here's a worse part, I have a car and she can't drive. So when she needed things she'd pretend to want to hang out and ""go check something out."" Usually then, we'd go back to her place and she'd cook something for me, and I wouldn't feel it was a total loss getting food for the gas spent. But the last two times I went over there she kept going on and on about how tired she was so I left. Basically, having been used as a free Uber. 

**But here's the worst part!**

The other day, on Valentine's Day, I called her up and she's busy chatting with strangers on Omegle. This one guy is flirting with her and she keeps telling me about how good he looks... and how he wants to do an online video date with her ""clothes optional."" The whole time she's giggling and basically ignoring what I'm saying. So I say I've got something to do and hang up. She has **the fucking nerve** to call me back and want a ride somewhere before she ""goes home to get some rest."" I keep it short and civil (what choice do people like us have?) and basically hang up and go to bed. 

The next day I texted her to ask ""how did your little e-date go?"" She responded ""huh?"" and I haven't talked to or heard from her since. Highly unusual because she *always* calls me several times on my 2 days off. Those days are over and I feel an incredible amount of stress about it.. my heart is going crazy and I feel like I'm waiting to get punished by the principle or something. 

I guess I lost whatever that was.. Life never wastes an opportunity to kick me when I'm down.",3

I was in therapy for a while, feeling good, but after a few years couldn’t afford it anymore. 5-6 months ago I was put on Setraline by my PCP and started therapy with BetterHelp (that therapy app). A month ago my therapist says she thinks I have BPD or bipolar depression or PTSD, maybe more than one. And I stop taking the setraline. Two weeks ago my therapist said she believes I have bipolar depression and need to seek additional support.

3399,"I act like a child and idk if it's just me or because of avpd People have commented before on this, and what it is, is that I basically look up to people in the way a child would look up to an adult, and I do this because I admire how other people my age act like real adults, and are confident and capable of doing adulty things. I absolutely am not a real adult, despite my age.

I also tend to want these people to look after me a bit/ make me feel safe/ protect me from other people because I view them as competent whilst I'm essentially an over grown child. I suppose this could stem from childhood trauma where I didn't feel protected maybe, so I now try to hide behind other people to feel safe. 

I don't know if anyone else experiences this. I've never seen anyone talk about something like this before so I fear I'm just a complete weirdo 🥲🥲. I'm not sure if this is actually a sign I have dependent personality disorder or something instead of being avpd related.

Nothing really happened that day, but I kept waking up 4am excited to do something and everything seemed very simple.

3407,"Nobody takes me seriously I’ve (24M) dealt with depression/anxiety for years now. I used to be great with people, make good money, have the nice cars, great girlfriend, supportive parents, friends that I could say looked up to me etc. and then I was diagnosed with depression. Within about a year, I quit my job, lost my girlfriend even though she was great to me, and have yet to keep a stable job for more than a month at a time. 

My depression eventually was ruled to be “treatment resistant” after being on a number of meds and trying many other things. Some would work for a couple months and then I’d fall even further back from where I was. 

But now, after not having worked since early July of 2022, I am dealing with extensive and scary brain fog. I’ve incorporated working out, eating healthier, taking supplements and just trying to live a healthier lifestyle as I figured this was coming from a bad diet my whole life. I also got all blood work done including thyroid, basics, vitamin levels, testosterone etc and everything came back normal other than pretty high cholesterol. Both doctors I’ve seen (general practitioner, psychiatrist) has kinda blown me off when I tell them about the brain fog. Almost like they don’t really know what to say or what the next step should be to ruling out causes. 

I’m so scared as I’m feeling like I’m going crazy or have dementia.

My mother would tell me I’m exactly the same type of person as the lyrics of this song describe. She called me a sociopath, someone really sick in the head and not redeemable. That I tried to purposely ruin my family’s lives. Like I had a secret agenda that even I couldn’t know about. It’s been the foundation of all of my relationships with others, and helps explain why I get so nervous trying to get close with anyone. Trying to connect while thinking I’m secretly extremely evil and unlovable and that I’m taking advantage of everyone just by wanting to talk with them. That everything I say is actually ‘calculated’ and manipulative, despite me being unaware of this. That my side of the story isn’t just shameful and wrong, it’s *evil and vile.*

Avoidant with BPD is contradictory hell. I’m hating closeness and trying to stay away but the other side of me is always getting too close in the relationships I can keep so they don’t leave me. I’m unbelievably stressed because I’m so close to disaster. I hate to vent to my best friend of several years because I feel like I’m being too greedy of her time. I feel like I’m “sucking off all the meat” of this relationship, taking up the space for my troubles, and then I don’t even improve. I know she’s going to leave when she discovers I’m actually a terrible person and that I don’t change. I can feel it creeping towards me and I want to die.

I feel like she’s only my friend because she falsely believes I have potential. I feel like I’ve somehow manipulated her into thinking I’m a nice person. I feel like I’m so much worse than she thinks. I can’t understand why someone would care about me, other than they must be confused thinking of the wrong person. I can’t believe the situation I’m in. It happens every single time, and I never learn.

I get her texts saying I need to try to get help and I just want to sink into the ground and die. I feel like I’ve done something really wrong and should stop talking to her. The answer is simple: stop avoiding therapy. Actually tell the therapist the truth. Everyone is sick of me including me.",3

One of the times my mouth was wide open, my throat completely dry, and my neck as stiff as a rock.

I was so exited about the films I would talk to almost everyone I came across about HP, well almost everyone told me I can’t/I will never be able too/that’s bad/ect but more than anything they would tell me I talk to much, it isn’t ladylike to speak that much. I was 5 years old. As the years went by I was told not to speak often, and anytime I spoke about anything I knew something of such as history or science and especially if I was excited about it I would be cut off and told I spoke to much. All of my “friends” growing up would ignore me in groups or not pay attention if I wanted to join the conversation. Bc of that I became a wall flower and I over tall when people talk to me.

3441,"Seeing some progress but feeling stuck. Hi,

24-year-old male with AVPD here. For some time I have noticed that contacts with other people (in my case only at work) began to bring me pleasure. I've also become more relaxed and when I'm around people I don't worry as much about how they react to what I say. At the same time, a desire for more close relationhips arosed in me. This desire applies both to finding a partner and friends. I just want, as real as never before in my life, a simple conversation with another person and intimacy.

However, I don't know how to achieve this. I've finished my education and I don't have any social hobbies (the gym can be considered as such, but I still can't find a way to start naturally a conversation with other people there). I'm starting to get annoyed with this situation, because certainly something has changed in my attiude and I truly want to form some relationships outside of my work environment. I think I'm ready to get out of my comfort zone step by step, but I don't know how to do it.

One way to do it is to start dating. Finding a partner is something that I want very strongly and I think love is something I'm capable of. The thing that's holding me back from making that move though (other than, well... the lack of photos to use on dating apps) is knowing that I'll be too much of a burden for her not having other relationships. Perhaps there is also an element of shame in not having any friends. I am not sure…

Have any of you reached such a point on your journey to ""normality""? I'm not sure if I'm over-analyzing everything and if I shouldn't just do what I feel regardless of my doubts. In my case, finding friends seems to be something more distant at the moment and I don't know how I could achieve it. However, I will be grateful for every piece od advice!",3

Instead...she died. I suspect she took her own life. No one told me. For 13 months I held resentment towards her. I didn't want to be with her but I was upset that she had made our relationship toxic. 

Instead, she was dead. Her family did not tell me. On tuesday her mother called me to tell me the news 13 months later. I am devastated. She did not deserve to die. I am so fucking angry at myself. I knew she was sick, I knew she was suicidal and I cut her off anyway. I'm angry at her family for denying me the ability to see her funeral. I'm angry that everyone else got a year to grief together and I am dealing with this loss alone.

I didn't message her for an entire year because I was convinced she found someone else and my pride wouldn't allow me to even say ""hi, hope all is well"".

I just hate myself so much that it makes me suicidal. I wish i was someone else entirely or that i just didn't exist. I've hated myself for most of my life. Probably since puberty and realizing i didn't look like the other girls and i was weird. I never fit in. I was always overweight and not conventionally pretty. Thru out my teen years i made so many bad choices - drop out, ex junkie then teen mom. Such an undesirable life. I can't even fathom how anyone could possibly love me. Stupid, crazy, ugly failure me.

3458,"Please Help: Months long delusion of abuse from manic episode - is this normal? Hey all,

I was recently diagnosed bipolar 1 but am sitting in the tattered remains of my life, wondering how I could have believed what I did.

I first felt symptoms of mania and intense narcissism this summer (I’m 28 yrs old). I had recently gone through a breakup with my partner of 6 years, had fallen in love with my female best friend (first queer experience) and she did not reciprocate my feelings, and my workload had become incredibly overwhelming.

I started losing weight and hair, had a stress rash on my body and was experiencing fluctuating feelings between paranoia to believing the universe was speaking to me directly.

But theres a delusion I am struggling with the most, that has left me feeling horrid and unforgivable. I believed my wonderful boss of 3 years had emotionally abused me, and was the reason I was experiencing mania and psychosis. I believed this so hard I convinced myself and my therapist/psychiatrist I had PTSD, and that my boss and workplace were all to blame. I told so many people this was what happened to me, because I truly believed it. I blocked my boss on everything and didn’t talk to her for 6 months.

This January I finally looked back at the texts that I thought “proved” I was abused, and found nothing but support and concern from a woman who never did anything but treat me with respect.

How the hell does this happen? Has anyone ever experienced anything similar? Honestly I’ve been feeling suicidal since the realization- I got fired from my job for other mistakes I made while manic, but I don’t know how to tell I everyone I talked to that what I believed for the last 6 months was a total lie.

Please help 😣",2

Eventually one of my friends showed up and soon after his friend left (this left,  me, my friend and him at a table that seats 4 people) soon after one of my other friends showed up so all the stats at the table where filled. we where all just working quietly for around an hour. after that hour he later  left and my friends left soon after. I spent another hour there by myself finishing up some work 

I am a big glancer I look around a lot whenever I am doing something so this has caused me and this boy to make a lot of eye contact. when I was taking a break from my work I saw him coming back into the building me and him made eye contact and he quickly walked away this was a bit of a surprise because he usually sits down 

I assumed that he either wanted the table for himself or he had some friends coming and needed a bigger table. so I moved seats I got up and went to a single table. I went to go fill up my water bottle after I placed my stuff down at the new table, when I was walking back to my new table I made eye contact with him again because he was walking the same direction. 

I sat down at my new table and put my AirPods in assuming that he moved to the table that sat 4 people, out of the corner of my eye I saw him walk up to my table. I took my AirPods out and he asked me ""hey, you didn't move seats because of me right?"" with ought even thinking I just quickly shook my head and said  ""oh no!"" before I could say anything else he said ""ok I was just making sure, have a nice day"" and he walked away.

I’ve wanted another dog for about 10 years and I thought it was a good time to get one now since I’m WFH. The puppy is about 3 months old and at around 2 months, she started throwing up. I took her to the emergency vet and found out she had an obstruction in her intestines. This meant she had to have surgery and her insurance hasn’t kicked in so I had to pay out of pocket. I had to take out a credit card to pay the 7K bill. She came home and was doing really well. Then 2 days ago she started throwing up again. She threw up around 6 times. I took her back to the vet and they had to run a bunch of tests again (another 1K) and it seems like a treat I gave her may have irritated her intestines again. They wanted to do more tests but I literally can not afford it. I spoke to the vet about it as none of this can be covered by insurance. The vet gave her an anti nausea medication and sent us home to observe her. She ate and hasn’t vomited but I’m still nervous about it all.

in the next days i had the worst chest pain i’ve ever experienced and i definitely thought i was gonna have a heart attack and die, one day it got really bad and my heart raced like crazy and i was shaking but no one was around and after a couple of minutes i was ok. i guess it was a panic attack (never had one before) so i brushed it off like nothing happened. 


in the next months i have been having these weird chest pain i thought i had a problem with my heart, but as days went by i noticed that the pain gets so much worst when i think about certain things. i’ve done so much to get rid of the pain yet it seems like it only gets worst.

i was watching a video on youtube the other day about a medical case and when they started to describe the symptoms that the patient had I HAD THE WORST CHEST PAIN SO FAR!! my heart was racing and my chest tightened i couldn’t breathe! 

googled it and got an “anxiety test”, idk what to do. it really fucked me up i thought i was crazy.

3489,"Something I wrote before I knew I was bipolar. I used to think it was a personality disorder, instead of a mood disorder.   

Dear Journal…well I really don’t know that much about you being dear… that’s clearly a lie as it is the first time I write in this type of journal -though I had been writing quite often on “my phone journal”-. Either way, dear beloved, and most precious electronic journal, I will bless thee with the presence of worded words that word the words I word. Today’s riveting topic…. My day! As I don’t think I have the mental capacity to write about anything else of meaning… or do I? The purpose of this journal thing is to make me a better writer in both English and Spanish, yet if all I put into the white walls is rubbish and nonsense, how am I to become better at throwing electronic ink at immaterial wood-stuff? Perhaps I should find something… as simple as it may be…something I can turn into cohesion. I guess it is as good a time as ever to speak about feelings… my feelings, nonetheless.

How does anxiety feel? I know we’ve all been there. Any E-scripture on anxiety that you might stumble upon will say as much, but, baring mental health professionals, I don’t think that those of us that enunciate the word “anxiety” with statistical-outlier levels of frequency have the same notion of the concept than those whose usage falls into the mean. What I mean by that, of course, is that those of us afflicted by pathological levels of anxiety feel it in a quantitively and qualitatively different way. I guess that’s why we get diagnosed… catalogued as distinct by the authorities that oversee defining this part of society. We’re a messy bunch. It reflects in all facets of my life.

I have messy hair, messy eyes, my room is messy my thoughts are scattered (and messy!), I can’t make a decision for the love of myself; the short version: I don’t work. I mean that both literally and figuratively, whatever that means! (think about it! What does the verb “to work” mean in a literal way? Is it having a job? But that’s having a job, we call it work because you do motions in a job, but we call the motions “work”, because “work” is the act of physical exertion right? I don’t know, this is literal garbage that I’m talking right now (talking/writing “garbage” can’t literally be literal (I think I just transferred a calque from Spanish, too long to get into this tangent))). I can’t hold a normal job; I can’t hold my emotions most of the times. Today some guy at the mall forgot my coffee, and I felt like as if I’ve murdered someone. I mean, I’ve never killed anyone -and I hope I never do such a heinous thing-, but you know that feeling you get in your chin, your chest and neck that pushes you down? The one you get when something bad, really bad is about to happen? I was feeling that over a coffee man. I stared the guy directly in the eye, not with the best of intentions. I was literally offended, but I don’t feel that it was in a normal way. How do I know that? Cause I didn’t use to be like that. Emotions, to me, seem to work now like to a BPD patient (perhaps I have BPD traits?). How do emotions work for BPD patients? Simple! Take an emotion X and then square it. A more detailed example: anger(in BPD afflicted individual) = anger\^2. Or perhaps it’s even a cubical function: i.e., anger\^3 (I don’t even remember if cube is exponential 3). Anxiety is writing parenthesis excusing yourself of mistakes in your personal journal entries that no one else will ever fucking read.

Anxiety is looking at your neighbor and running away inside your home for no reason. Anxiety is feeling gutted for dreaming about the people that made you the happiest you’ve been in ages. Anxiety is snapping at those who love you, because you can’t love yourself and everything has a bitter taste to shit. Anxiety is wanting to die, looking at places where you could hang yourself, feeling relief at the thought of no longer breathing, imagining a knife to the throat, thinking about swerving into traffic, travelling, and not feeling anything, kissing someone you’re deeply into and not feeling anything, doubting everything you do, every single cell in your body being inadequate. Anxiety is knowing at a scientific level that something is wrong, but still suffering through it. Anxiety is abusing drugs, anxiety is depression, anxiety is the antithesis of life, of enjoyment, of love and all that’s good. This is “anxiety”, as this is obviously a corrupted, poisonous version of a feeling that’s supposed to help us survive: i.e., anxiety. “Anxiety” turns a survival tool against those who are trying to survive.

I started chatting again with this girl that i had ghosted after asking her out on another app almost exactly a year ago. I was surprised that she would match with me again, this time i decided to go trough with it though. What helped i think is that she is of a pretty similar personality type as me, not a big time texter and sometimes slow to respond etc..

I decided to be just totally honest when we met, i told her I'm not the most exciting guy and that I'm pretty boring honestly, but i said it with kind of a smile and a good attitude. We ended up holding hands walking trough the city and i kissed her on the way to my car and again when i dropped her off. 

It felt like there might be some hope after all. She asked me what we should do next time, and i had no answer because i hadn't even considered it could ever come to that. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just had to tell someone. I'm not trying to brag. If anything its an example that even if your feel inadequate and unworthy, like i do often, its mostly on the inside. I've told myself no-one will ever like me, this is simply untrue, and if you feel this way its most likely untrue for you too.",3
3498,"Chronic stress help I really wish anyone can help me or i just wanna know if anyone is experiencing the same things i am because i havent found anyone who has. Im getting headaches/migraines every single day. Its been around 2 months now, this isnt the first time this has happened to me it happened 2 years ago same thing. I had migraines every single day non stop for like a year straight, to the point where i couldnt even eat and developed photophobia and couldtn even turn on my room lights or anything. So it eventually went away after a couple months but im back in here again. Doctors tell me that its stress/anxiety but it just doesnt make sense to me as to why it gets this bad to the point where i cant even get up from my bed or be awake for long hours before feeling pain, no one gets it this bad for this long, 7+ months NON Stop??? So it started around November with panic attacks and anxiety, usually something triggers my anxiety and i can control it, but no not this time it happens even when im happy out of nowhere i just feel bad all the time and super weak, then it progressed to me feeling okay in the morning and bad at night, i always knew id feel bad at night so i would do my daily duties during the day. Then it progressed even more to where i started getting my migraines/headaches every day and the light started triggering them. And now end of march im back in my room again lights off, headaches everyday, cant go out cant do anything, i can barely even be on my phone, lights all the way down and blue light off. I did notice though that it starts in my neck and shoulders and where my arms start on my back. I massage myself everyday, i try to take medications but they all give me extreme side effects even tylenol. I know itll be a few months before i get better, but i wish i knew more people that have gone thru this, i even tried magnesium gummies and got side effects from those as well. Ive been doing so well with my anxiety and i try to feel okay and get distracted but the pain never ever ever goes away just gets worse and calms down, please someone help!",0

However last year and a half i've felt like my symptoms have changed a lot, though i still have all the BPD symptoms, some symptoms like avoidance, social anxiety, isolation, feeling less, came up from nowhere. For matter of fact, i stopped talking to all my ""friends"", stopped working, going out, date, i stopped living. This winter i didn't go out of my appartement, and if it wasn't for my mother, i would probably have died of hunger. Going out doesn't scare me, people outside does. I feel like they all stare at me and they know how shitty i am, i feel like i'm not like them and whatever i do i'm not enough. Even open the shutters is a damn burden. Sometimes i think i might be paranoid, but i don't think people wan't me any harm nor i feel persecuted, i'm just ashamed of myself...

My partner asked what I had eaten and I told him. He proceeded to tel me all about how I could get diabetes or become obese if I don’t make better food choices and I need to make more nutritious meals for myself. 

Which I understand and I know he’s coming from a good place with good intentions. But I also did not ask for his opinion and was just trying to put something in my system so I could take my meds today.

3506,"Hopelessness/Too lateness Is there a point where one can consider it too late to do anything? Too late to try; too late to get treatment; too late for anything and everything? Too old? Or if someone is ""too badly off?"" I've seen some people around Reddit and the net refer to failed lives. I've recently made posts and tried to look around Reddit for people in a similar situation as mine and there seems to be *nobody*. And the only conclusion I can draw is that my circumstances are too uniquely screwed up. And AvPD along with other issues all intersecting have led to a completely failed life and me as a broken mess. Growing up (or developing) AvPD in a family full of NPD didn't help.

Most subs seem to skew younger, which has me think that everybody either resolved their issues as they grew up or are no longer alive. How has anybody dealt with utter despair and hopelessness? Feeling too old and that it's too late to change anything satisfactorily? Does anyone have other issues/diagnoses that mix with AvPD to just make things impossible?",3
3507,"I’ve recently been getting closer to reaching proper nutrition everyday and it’s made more of an improvement than any antidepressant I’ve ever been put on has the more I learned about nutrition the more I applied it to my diet, then one day I couldnt afford healthy foods and had to eat processed foods and a few times had fast food because it was better than declining and getting no calories at all. 

by the end of the first day I was doing worse again. I didn’t notice the correlation until a week later when I could get healthy food again and saw the recent things I ate (I’ve been keeping track to do the math on how much nutrition I was getting)

by the end of the day after eating healthy foods again, not even getting close to the proper amount for my age and weight, just having some I felt noticeably better. I was more productive,able to focus a bit more, moving wasnt something I had to work up motivation for, and I didn’t have to spend as much time getting myself out of the ‘I wanna lay here until I start to decay’ kinda mind.

its kinda soul crushing and liberating at the same time. after a childhood of depression, trauma, neglect, then a few years of pure hell and not feeling any of the positive things even for a moment, I actually have control over one of the things thats contributed to life being unbearable. 

but now I’m realizing if baby me had healthy food options and someone to explain nutrition, it wouldnt have been as unbearable. to what extent, I don’t know. its too depressing to imagine. 

anyway the point is, pls prioritize your personal nutrition. I’ve tried so many things my entire life to feel okay, but without the components it needs, your brain just cant do very well. I tried to eat as healthy as possible as I got older, but even the seemingly healthy options I had available to me still left me very deficient. 

(obviously malnutrition isnt the only thing that causes depression, but it has a huge effect. a lot of foods are marketed to seem healthy even if the producer is cutting every possible corner to make as much money as cheaply as possible. with how prominent that is, you should look closely at the actual amounts of nutrition in the things you eat and drink)",1

Hi, idk if this is in the right place but I just need to get stuff out.
I (24f) should be so happy an excited, I'm getting married next week. I love my Fiance, and I want to marry him. 
But I've had to move hundreds of miles away from my mum and my friends. 
I have BPD and probably autism, but NHS won't help me get diagnosis for either.

I haven't been working and been living with my parents becase of depression. Now because me and husband can barely afford a basic place to live I will have to work. And I want to. I want to be so capable and successful and hard working but I just want to kms anytime I think of getting up and going out.

I've only been living in my new town a week, and everytime i remember im not going home i feel so depressed. 

All my Fiance can say is he's sorry. But that doesn't fix anything or help me or comfort me at all, and my BPD shuts any suggestions he has down because substitues wont help. I don't know anyone here,   and everyone in my community is old. And whilst yes old people can make lovely friends, It's not the same.

I can't drive, afford to drive or have the mental stability to drive so I feel so lonely and depressed.

And I feel so awful for my fiance when I'm literally saying I'm depressed and I don't want to be here. 

I just want to be hit by a car or something, every day my brain says stuff like that and I'm so tired of holding it together.

I don't want to be here. And yet as always I'll carry on. I'll just ""cope"". I won't kms. But it hurts all the same.",1

It's a sickening feeling like you know something awful is going to happen even though you also know it's not really life or death.

3522,"I broke down during my psych appointment today. So much regret. I had my monthly psych appointment a few hours ago and this came just as my depression got progressively worse the past few days. I had been ruminating about this for a while, because I was freaking myself out reading about meds on the internet, and I asked him what cocktail I was on way back when I started seeing him a year and a half ago after I got discharged from the hospital. He read the list to me and I immediately started crying. It was so much. It all came back to me and I remembered how miserable it made me. 15mg olanzapine, 1200mg lithium, forgot how much effexor, along with anafranil. I was in such a terrible place for a year constantly trying to work around those meds and getting unstable anytime I tried to get off of one. I couldn't feel pleasure, I was tired all the time, lost interest in all my hobbies and in life, felt stupid and dumb and numb, lost my libido, was emotionally flatlined (my fucking grandfather died while I was on these and I felt nothing) and I felt so hopeless. I had to get a job because I took a year away from school and I sucked at it so hard because of my lethargy and my tremors.

A year and a half later, my cocktail is completely different and manageable: 250mg Lamictal, 50mg Prozac, 2.5mg olanzapine (tapering), and thinking of adding wellbutrin. but I broke down because of the regret and the time wasted and the amount of depression and numbness and pain I had to go through. Weren't the meds supposed to make me feel better? I remember initially the previous doctor from the outpatient suggested maybe lowering the dose or switching to a different AP, but I declined and I regret that so much. I regret that I never got to give Lamictal a shot initially before I was hospitalized because I tried it for a few days and my mom thought I was getting a bad reaction. I regret that I ever took stimulants or smoked or that this pandemic ever happened or that I made the stupid mistake that led to the trauma which all collectively resulted in my episode.

I want to move forward, but I still feel like I'll never get back who I was all those years ago. My psych said that the brain is constantly changing and growing and healing. But I want my old brain back, I don't care about it growing, I want to feel what I used to feel. I broke down right after the session ended really hard and my dad talked me through it. I feel bad for what I've put my parents through the past two years. I've had to take a second leave of absence from school and I'm not sure if I'm in a position to go back again. Feel like I've ruined my life and I can't move forward, no matter how good the new meds are and how well I do in treatment, my mind will never forget that medication cocktail and those doses and how it wrecked me.",2

I dont have many friends besides a few online friends, and lately i feel like they're distancing themselves from me and I deal with rejection sensitivity and along with the avpd I feel like its all eating away at me.

I worked around 11-12 hours on average so it makes me stressed at first.

Then a few days ago when I got home from work (around 11pm almost midnight) my dad called me in to have a talk with him, then he explains that he's worried about my health and my body health. At first I didn't think about it much. Me and my father didn't go well for a long time so I think of it more as of a warning, however it turned to make me angry and stressed as he simulate what will happen to me by imagining if I were turned into a disabled person and unable to move at all, with me still able to talk. I got so stressed and tired enough that I didn't get enough sleep after I finally got to excuse myself.

And comes up to today as I had enough with today as I tend after their store and I was a little loopy, I looked like I was sleeping when I'm actually trying to stay awake. The owner called me that he's been watching me sleeping for 15 minutes and he's going to cut my pay. Then he ordered me to go to wash my face. i did before coming back, so angry and annoyed that I slapped the store's security camera, HARD. Luckily it didn't break just the camera cable disconnected so it's an easy fix. So I just called the manager and told them that the camera accidentally fell to the ground and broke, saying that it worked fine after I reassembled it. I was a little panicked but a little less stressful from that.

Sorry it's more of a rant post, but I do need help managing my own stress and it just came up almost everyday. How do I do it? I felt like I could explode at any point right now.",0

3568,"I was triggered while talking to an old school friend and crashed the interaction This happened 9 month ago.

I (M,50) was being approached by a woman that was in the same class in school with me some 30+ years ago. 

I was just loading groceries into my car when she drove past behind me and said loudly: ""oh hey, that's a familiar face... :-)"". 

I turned around and was pleasantly surprised to see her... we started to talk, she said she has seen me in this supermarket before. 

We exchanged some small talk... what do you do, where do you live, do you still have contact with the people of the past... this kind of stuff. 

I already was kind of nervous, because of the small talk situation, but when the topic of the other people from the past came up, i began to panic. 

The thing is, that i was being bullied for the 5 years that I was in this class. Not from her, she was always nice.

But the time in this class left it's marks and I didn't want to have anything to do with the people from these circles after I was done there.

So at the end of our talk she asked if we should exchange numbers... and i froze. 

There were just so many thoughts in my head, but i couldn't say any of them because none of these were appropriate for a casual conversation after 30 years.

A small part of me was flattered that she remembered me and cared to approach me.

But all the other parts of my brain were actively persuading me why this was not a good idea:

""when i exchange numbers i will have to be prepared for her to call/text anytime, i don't like this.""

""i clearly still have a problem with the ""old times"" and the people from the past.""

""when i call/text with her then i will have to explain this sooner or later or just lie and pretend that these things did not affect me.""

""this is not the kind of topic that i can casually bring up after 30 years, so i can't explain this, and don't think that i can lie, either...""

""besides, if i exchange numbers then i will have to, well, talk... text... ask questions... like a normal person, and since i live very isolated, i kind of forgot how to do this.""

""and what do i do if she wants to get a coffee... or meet others..."" 

""it's better to just end this here now and not exchange numbers.""

""but i can't say that i don't want to exchange numbers, who does something like this? i would have to explain this.""

I was spiraling...

I'm not sure how long i stood there saying nothing. I guess she could tell from my face that there was a problem.

Then she said: ""you don't have to say anything"".

I think I mumbled something like ""okay"", and ""it was really nice meeting you"" and we parted.

I should have just exchanged the number and go from there.

I really would have liked to be able to do this, but i couldn't.

I regret this now, and i am constantly thinking if i should contact her (I know her address but of course not her phone number, so i would have to write a letter i guess) and try to explain things.

At least tell her that it \*really\* was nice seeing her and that my reaction (or lack thereof), was not because of her, but had other personal reasons.

But of course, everything is much more awkward now than if i would just have exchanged the number...",3

And while a lot of these habits/things are enjoyable in the moment, once I push past my ""but I don't wanna"" inner toddler brain, I'm so sick of having to do so much all the time just to maintain ""okay"".And truth be told, lately, I haven't.

3580,"Social anxiety-geared remedies and treatments have made things worse **Trigger warning for suicidal ideation mention.
Also, long post alert. This is something that’s been brewing for a while that I hadn’t been able to articulate until now.

I’m 24 years old. I’ve been actively trying to combat social anxiety since I was 17. And after reflecting on these past years, I truly feel like all of the things I did to try to improve have only made my feelings worse and solidified my fears. 

For example, public speaking: I was told throughout school and therapy that practicing public speaking would make it easier over time. I was also told I would need to do a lot of it to have a successful career. 

So, I did the following: joined the media club in high school, where I made intercom announcements and once made a TV announcement. Taught Spanish to children as an assignment. Took opportunities to read aloud in class and chose speaking assignments when given the choice. In college: I had several mandatory presentations. I joined clubs, and did almost weekly public speaking for various purposes for them. I called numbers for a bingo game for over 100 people and also proctored a club election. I then became a resident advisor which involved pretty regular public speaking. 

Let me tell you, it did NOT get easier y’all lmao. I swear to god, I kept telling myself it would get better and waiting for it to get easier and it only got harder emotionally. I definitely improved my skills, but every public speaking incident wreaked absolute havoc on my psyche. Like throwing up beforehand, staying up and ruminating after, shaking, emotional anguish, insomnia, the works. Like I’d argue it got even worse as time went on. No amount of praise was ever able to shake it, and i’ve received some pretty consistent positive feedback. I have this thought of like, probability. Like I WILL fuck up and embarrass myself during an event. And every time a speech goes well, I feel like my odds of failure increase. Plus I’m not sure how much I trust the positive feedback I’ve gotten. I can accept that I’m an effective speaker, but anything more than that feels fake like people are lying to make me feel better. 

So, public speaking hasnt gotten easier. I’m out of options. And it’s frustrating that no one around me understands this because, to them, I’m a sufficient speaker. But the idea of speaking to a group of people makes me want to fucking kill myself. Like every time. And now… I have a ton of lovely memories that play in my head when I think of speaking. Like my brain has the motherload of material to make me feel deep levels of shame, embarrassment, regret, anxiety, etc. 

I wish i’d never started doing this stuff because now people actually expect it of me and I am haunted by awful memories that make me feel worse than I did before. I mean for fuck’s sake, I’ll get in a panic because I remembered speaking to KIDS. Six year olds. Who the fuck is embarrassed to speak to six year olds? Remembering things like this can straight-up ruin an otherwise perfect day and completely sour my mood. 

It’s not just public speaking. Its making friends, joining clubs, volunteering, working, the works. I faced my fears and they fought back viciously. And after covid isolation, I find it literally impossible to force myself to try these things again, even though I know I’m capable of them. I just don’t want to contribute to the material my brain uses against me. I feel full, like I’m out of storage space. I’m just sick of the regret and embarrassment and guilt over existing the way I did. 

I feel like I’m destined to spend my future disappointing people and failing. I’ll never be like I once was, and even if I do then it will just be exhausting and miserable. Right before covid I was reaching a breaking point anyway—like I was about to quit my job (or get fired) and possibly school because I couldn’t handle the hole I’d dug myself into. I feel spent and directionless. I dont know what my goals are anymore. I don’t even know who I am because I spent so long trying to be someone I’m not.",3

3591,"Very sudden onset of physical anxiety symptoms? Hi all,

I never struggled with anxiety like this before, when suddenly I had a panic attack for the first time last month - I felt suddenly extremely uncomfortable and ""trapped/unsafe"" in the minutes leading up to it but the whole time I was still thinking rationally. But the physical symptoms were definitely there and since then I've been having these mini bouts of extremely rapid hyperventilation just randomly through the day and tightness/pain in the chest/stomach. 

These originally happened whenever I thought any remotely negative thought at all, but now they're just popping up at random times. Currently I'm sat here with my stomach in knots and feeling like I'm about to cry for absolutely no reason at all. I wouldn't say I'm very worried about anything in particular (just the normal things I've been a little stressed about my whole life, like school) but it's getting really annoying to have these small (or on occasion, full-blown) anxiety attacks nearly every day. 

Again, this is all completely new to me. I'm prone to overstressing or worrying at times but these symptoms don't seem to be completely related to that since they come on so randomly and I feel like they would have popped up sooner during more stressful times in my life? If anyone has any insight it would be much appreciated, because it's getting really freaking annoying and interfering with my schoolwork and personal relationships. At this point would something like therapy even help me if it's so primarily physical? What do I do??? Thank you!",4

3605,"Why do I find the Spring so depressing? A lot of people talk about the Winter blues, but for me Spring by far (at least in recent years), is painfully depressing. 

It’s like the smell in the air, mixed with the temperature and longer/brighter daytime present this fake sense of happiness. 

It’s as if when I’m outside, things seem “too happy” and that scent in the air is gut-wrenchingly nostalgic of a past-time that can never be felt or experienced again. Because I’m not capable of it and I’m too worn-down to, anyway. 

I actually remember when I was little (29 now) that I loved clear, sunny weather. I looked up the forecast almost obsessively ahead of time, banking on those days of where there are no clouds to block the sun. Not even partly cloudy. 

It’s perplexing to think I was once like this since nowadays, I despise sunny weather. I genuinely feel better and more comfortable when it is cloudy with rain. Especially the eccentric types of weather where it looks as if nighttime has arrived too early, but instead it’s just a storm brewing. Not to mention, I am at my peak mindset and performance late at night. 

What the hell happened.",1

3607,"Anxiety has ruined me Just a vent tbh .

I've suffered from anxiety my whole life and as I grow older, I feel my anxiety getting progressively worse instead of better. Ironically even therapy scares me as I'm not really one to ""open up"" in front of others in fear of burdening/boring them. Sounds silly but I almost feel embarrassed paying someone to help me who otherwise wouldnt give me a second thought

On the topic of skills, I wholeheartedly believe I have 0 skills. I've always been told I'm smart but no one sees how much time and struggle goes behind good grades. When I'm honest about not being intelligent, understandably people think I'm fishing for compliments.  Even then I think I just got lucky with good questions and random guesses. Literally no achievement I think I really deserved and was more abt the odds being in my favour. Its all due to subliminals and manifestation rather than talent

As well, my social skills are horrendous. I'm so awkward w people and can barely keep a convo going with those close to me. I rely on them to start and keep convos going cause I'm just so boring and unfunny. I have an extremely hard time communicating with males too. Idk I completely stiffen up and come across so awkward. I like art but again I'm not talented at it despite so much practice and was rejected from an art school unsurprisingly. I'm learning to drive and after 3 lessons I still can't move a car without sweating buckets, shaking and struggling to control it, even moving off is so challenging.  I'm expecting to waste a ton of money due to my incompetence at understanding basic instructions and crippling fear. I'm bad at sports, games , mediocre at cooking and just about everything I've tried. Heck I can't even ride a bike

I couldn't list a single talent I have. Anything I'm half decent at is a result of 5x the effort generally needed. For example I'm currently writing an essay thats taken me all day to understand and plan when it was only meant to be an hour task. There just doesn't seem to be anything 'redeemable' for me

My anxiety has made me become more and more closed off from people. I will sit in toilets at school in fear of being looked at. I never contribute to class in fear of being wrong. I sit on the bus with my hood on so I'm not looked at. Even when I briefly had a job, I couldn't work out the basics that everyone learnt in a day. It was very telling that this incompetence wasn't only reflecting in school but other places. Sweating is one of the main symptoms I experience and its created deep rooted insecurities for me

I can stay somewhat in peace at home but I do have struggles here and there. But obviously its not practical to rely on home for peace as I fear I will completely isolate myself this way

3636,"Feeling Overwhelmed? It takes more to overwhelm some people than others, but the feeling and the impact are the same: overload and not knowing which way to turn next which triggers a downward spiral of anxiety.

### Take these steps to create a plan and go from feeling overwhelmed to feeling peaceful again:

**Identify what you can and can’t control.** List your issues in three columns: what you can control, what you can influence and what is out-with your control.  

**Focus on solutions.** Now that you have perspective on what you can and can’t control, identify your chosen end point for each issue. Shift your focus from the problems to the solutions.

**Prioritise your actions.** Consider your chosen solutions in terms of how important they are and how urgent they are. Firstly, deal with the issues that are both important and urgent then move to the other important issues. As a general rule, deal with the important issues over the urgent issues: here-in lies the path to living sustainably crisis free.

**Communicate.** With your plan in place, communicate with those who may be affected: it’s incredible how supportive people can be once they understand your situation.

**Eat well.** Overwhelm commonly leads to skipping meals or over-reliance on junk food. Buy in some healthy foods and snacks to give you the nutrition you’ll need to play your best game.

**Gratitude.** It is easy to lose sight of the good things happening when we feel overwhelmed. Adopt the habit of regularly reflecting on the things you’re grateful for: that you’re taking control of challenging situations, that you’re on your way to calmer times, that you’re learning a lot about yourself, perhaps that others are supporting you.

**Blow off some steam.** Exercise – whatever works best for you: a brisk walk, hit the weights, an hour on the bike – has a magical ability to burn off that anxiety and re-set all those neurotransmitters. It will also help you get that good night’s sleep.

**Get your rest.** Know that you’re focusing on your priorities with a clear plan. You’re pushing yourself hard through the day. A good night’s sleep is the smartest thing you can give yourself to keep working through your list.  

**Celebrate your successes.** Each step forward is worthy of celebration. Be proud of yourself for taking control and moving forward. Each success leads to further steps forward.  
   
 

**Overwhelm is a situation everyone is familiar with. Short term episodes are unlikely to harm us. Longer term however, it can be debilitating. Remember there is help out there for those times you need support in getting back on top of things.**",0

- Risky decisions in terms of conversations with friends, putting myself in a physically dangerous position, and the things I put inside my body

- Sensory issues specifically with touch
- Making boatloads of artwork (it’s my hobby)

My vulnerable narcisstic brother (over 30yo) ''pretends'' not to like the dog, he doesn't actually hurt the dog but he pretends not to like it and the dog can sense it and feels confused. He moves between this and making a joke about it in front of others to cover himself that it is just purely an act. For example, i know he will have some pictures taken with the dog showing that he likes the dog so if anything were to happen he would play victim. (yet he will keep them hidden)

My nmon knows my brother does this out of insecurity towards me and she plays to it, when I speak to her on the phone she will bring my, brother, into the conversation even when I was not talking about him she pretends to mishear that id asked him a question just so he can say something like''' im just busy punching the dog' then my nmom gleefully says back to me he says he's says he is punching the dog,  and she does this to make sure I say something back so they get the reaction their looking for even though she knows I can hear perfectly well what he said. I dont take the bait but says something to move the conversation along like'' sounds pretty lame''.

They do this routine all the time in different ways and my nbrother has even started a new one where he jokes about getting ready for his fight with me and my nmon plays to this aswell, encouraging the imaginary conflict and trying to bait me into saying something back that escalates the situation. Of course again if anything were too happen I would be blamed regardless of the outcome cause it's all just a joke after all. Making vague threats of violence and beng low-key mean to the dog.

My nmon has done this in the past with her ex bf she would vaguely threaten me with him and she would encourage them to ''step up'' and  argue with me when they didn't really want too. That led to a fight one time with her bf confronted my youngest brother and cornered him in the bathroom He came out crying and said he got punched which led me to react and a fight.

I see it,

My life is propelled,

A mandate from heaven,

Audience anticipates it,

They clap until it sounds like thunder,

Grasping their bellies until they roll out of their chairs,

“He’s doing it again! Another meltdown.”

Born and grew with a face of a child,

“You’re so cute!”

Seems peculiar but I sure found something for my phenotype,

They pay for my dinners,

They buy me flowers,

Made me feel secure when I was not stable,

I like to be treated,

Like to be shown you care,

Then I feel intolerable,

And have been called things for a previous lifestyle,

Maybe I am what I am told I am,

What brings admiration and material turns to my curse,

For when I fall apart and turn to a spectacle…

It is something to merely laugh at,

Frustration and cries for help get treated as hysterical,

Suicidal ideation and attempts get treated as mere pouts,

Nothing that serious,

Even more certain I have no right to myself.",2

As I was lying there, she kept nipping at my heels and barking when I told her to stop. Finally, my anger boiled over and I yelled at her. I said awful things to her that I don’t want to repeat, even to strangers on the internet. I put her in her crate and went to the bathroom to take a bath and calm down. I feel so awful about it and I hate feeling like this and hurting others. My medicine is supposed to help me but as soon as I started taking it again, this happened.

3696,"Advice? tw: self-harm, bad thoughts? I'm not really sure what else, sorry

So uh, I've been feeling down and really anxious for thr past few weeks. It's probably silly, but I cut myself a while ago snd I hadn't done that for a while so I think it's really getting a low point. And it's probably just because of my poor emotional regulation stuff, but I kinda need to get this out because I don't have anyone else to talk to about this.

To start with, my academic workload's increased these past few weeks. I'm doing a research paper with a group, but it's just stressing me out. I'm um overthinking about how it would fail? Or if I'm not a good leader and I'm affecting my classmates' grades because of it. It's just, well, the thought of it is always there, and I can't really get rid of it because it's not yet done. 

Then there's this family tree project that we have, and I'm using my mom's family with it— I'm not really close with my dad's side of the family, so I can't exactly switch to his family. Uh the problem is, my mom has problems with her family, and I don't want to bring it up so I keep putting it off. I don't want to make her upset, and the thought of doing so is just making me anxious.

There's also the little things. Exams, quizzes, presentations, etc. I failed a quiz for the first time in a few years and my teacher got upset about it so I'm kinda panicking and trying to review more haha

Then well my birthday's coming up. We had this whole catering thing going on, but there's been problems with the payment and stuff. Mom made a mistake because she was outside when the manager asked for the payment, and she got really stressed because she couldn't get her money back. The manager hasn't exactly been cooperative, and they've been insistent on the payment, so yeah. Mom got angry and kinda blamed me cause I was the one who liked the idea of the catering thing. I promised her that I would take care of it since it was mostly my fault since she didn't like it but I pushed, so I've been in contact with the manager and everything but the situation's still messy. It's just more stress? More anxiety. Hooray, I guess.

We're still not done with the preparations and stuff and I really want to help but I've been busy with school, and when I get home there's no time to go outside and get what's needed. It's stressing Mom out, and I think that's part of the reason why she got angry, so I wanted to get this done. But I can't, and I have to wait for the weekends to actually be able to do stuff.

There's also the scholarship tests, although I've already taken them. It's just making me nervous, because if I didn't pass then it would be difficult to go to college becaude my family isn't really financially stable. It's just pressuring me? I think? I'm having trouble identifying how I feel without wanting to break down lol

It's also hard to fall asleep. I feel like the only rest I get is the minutes before I fall asleep, so I try to prolong it as long as possible. I think I'm afraid of waking up tomorrow because it just means that nothing's resolved yet and I just. Yeah.

Uh, that's it I guess. Sorry if this is all negative. If you have some advice (especially about the sleeping thing), it's all welcome! Thanks.",4

3710,"Overstressing everything Hey, joined this community just now since I kinda need some life advice, from anyone.

I've always been stressing out a lot over various things, but as of recently I started to realise that it has taken over my life in various ways. 

For example, even as of recently I was supposed to drive a group of friends to a theme park. Just a fun day, but the responsibility of driving my friends there somehow made me insanely nervous, even though I was ""calm inside"" if that makes sense. As a result I slept 0 hours in total. Melatonin didn't work, meditating did nothing, breathing exercises did nothing, my mind just kept on racing.  
(p.s. a friend drove in my car for me, I'm not driving on 0 hrs of sleep)

  
It's not just that single event though. School days cause stress, tests cause stress, even having a totally free day but having to receive a package the next day causes sleep issues and stomach aches.   
When doing things I'm always thinking about the worst thing that could happen, and what if that would happen, even if the chances are minimal, which only adds up to the stress.  
Idk anymore, should I visit a psychiatrist? Like what do you do here? This has been ongoing for at least 10 years now, I'm currently 22 and this has to stop

I seem to do this without thinking and I am sure to people walking past, it looks a bit strange! I remember also in the past when I would get anxiety attacks or feelings of even slight panic, I would start touching my neck (maybe almost unconsciously due to my breathing). Not sure if it helps, but when I am not able to do it easily (say when driving or holding something) I feel a bit worse if that makes sense.

 These habits have developed very randomly for me over time and seem to come out as soon as I start having symptoms of anxiety and anxious thoughts.

I've been dealing with my anxiety since I was 17. Since then, I've been looking for ""triggers"" that makes me feel more anxious. Like a pattern. So I could deal better with it (I dont have any pro help). I've realized that my anxiety gets worse when I have to talk with people. So, I've been trying to better my communication. And Im better, actually. I'm feeling more calm around other people. 

But there is something that it's haunting me since I'm trying to better my anxiety. I realized that there are some people that makes me worse. Sometimes even colleagues. For some reason, when I see them or talk with, I have a bad feeling, a heavy energy, and my anxiety explodes. Because of that, I cant trust on them. And I'm always in the ""alert mode"" when I'm around them. I don't know if this is a problem that my anxiety creates in my mind or if it's something that other people also feels.

That's why i'm here. I'm trying to understand if the problem is me and my anxiety or them. Anyone feels like this around some people?

I recently had a very bad depression episode few days ago, and even though I am done with the episode and my emotions are more stable right now, my brain doesn’t seem to be functioning in any way. 

I thinking of everything but nothing at the same time. Like I really can’t catch my thoughts or even think anything logically or sensibly. And I feel like a zombie, just do everything based on experience and instinct.

And the worst part is, people don’t understand that because you look completely normal and functional. They think you’re fine now because you stop crying or being depressed. You can finish normal tasks or conversation because you are in autopilot mode, but when it comes to something that requires more brainpower, you are broken.

And sometimes it takes weeks or months to really snap out it but life doesn’t give you the luxury of doing that. It stresses me out.

It feels like I'm trying to move a pillar from my chest and sometimes I just wanna die. But I'm determined. I had one major moment of rejection today and I felt awful, one of the worst feelings.

3753,"After years of resistance, I’m finally considering going on Disability……. So, I started my mental health journey at the age of 20. I was initially diagnosed Bipolar 2, and tried a number of medications that either didn’t work, or made me worse.

The bad experience with medication caused me to “take a break” from medication, off and on. 

Around the age of 25 I was hospitalized for a manic episode. A year later, when I was 26, I was hospitalized again for another manic episode.

Finally, around the age of 27, I started seeing a new psychiatrist, and she put me on Abilify, and to my surprise, I finally felt stable, happy, and “normal”.

Over the years, I have had to adjust my Abilify every now and again, but can usually get stable fairly quickly.

Until now. 

I began having hypomanic symptoms about a week ago, so we raised my Abilify to 30MGS and added 5MGS of Zyprexa.

Maybe I’m being impatient, it’s only been two days, but I’m still having hypomanic symptoms. And on top of that, I’m having balance and coordination issues.

My fear is that the Abilify is no longer working, and I am accepting the possibility that I may have to start from square one.

Which means medication trial and error, and with my past bad experiences with medication, I may be completely dysfunctional for God knows how long.

Which leads me to considering possibly going on Disability. I know it’s not easy to get, and could take up to a year to receive benefits, which is a concern.

I also feel going on Disability may lower my self esteem. To be clear, I don’t judge others that are on it who really need it. It’s just a personal issue I have, I really want to work and function in the real world.

And I know you also have to jump through a bunch of hoops to get Disability, and even when I’m “stable” I tend to give up easily.

So yeah. I guess I’m posting because I’m really on the fence about this. I’m scared, worried and feel shame.

3773,"Something I wrote before I knew I was bipolar. I used to think it was a personality disorder, instead of a mood disorder.   

Dear Journal…well I really don’t know that much about you being dear… that’s clearly a lie as it is the first time I write in this type of journal -though I had been writing quite often on “my phone journal”-. Either way, dear beloved, and most precious electronic journal, I will bless thee with the presence of worded words that word the words I word. Today’s riveting topic…. My day! As I don’t think I have the mental capacity to write about anything else of meaning… or do I? The purpose of this journal thing is to make me a better writer in both English and Spanish, yet if all I put into the white walls is rubbish and nonsense, how am I to become better at throwing electronic ink at immaterial wood-stuff? Perhaps I should find something… as simple as it may be…something I can turn into cohesion. I guess it is as good a time as ever to speak about feelings… my feelings, nonetheless.

How does anxiety feel? I know we’ve all been there. Any E-scripture on anxiety that you might stumble upon will say as much, but, baring mental health professionals, I don’t think that those of us that enunciate the word “anxiety” with statistical-outlier levels of frequency have the same notion of the concept than those whose usage falls into the mean. What I mean by that, of course, is that those of us afflicted by pathological levels of anxiety feel it in a quantitively and qualitatively different way. I guess that’s why we get diagnosed… catalogued as distinct by the authorities that oversee defining this part of society. We’re a messy bunch. It reflects in all facets of my life.

I have messy hair, messy eyes, my room is messy my thoughts are scattered (and messy!), I can’t make a decision for the love of myself; the short version: I don’t work. I mean that both literally and figuratively, whatever that means! (think about it! What does the verb “to work” mean in a literal way? Is it having a job? But that’s having a job, we call it work because you do motions in a job, but we call the motions “work”, because “work” is the act of physical exertion right? I don’t know, this is literal garbage that I’m talking right now (talking/writing “garbage” can’t literally be literal (I think I just transferred a calque from Spanish, too long to get into this tangent))). I can’t hold a normal job; I can’t hold my emotions most of the times. Today some guy at the mall forgot my coffee, and I felt like as if I’ve murdered someone. I mean, I’ve never killed anyone -and I hope I never do such a heinous thing-, but you know that feeling you get in your chin, your chest and neck that pushes you down? The one you get when something bad, really bad is about to happen? I was feeling that over a coffee man. I stared the guy directly in the eye, not with the best of intentions. I was literally offended, but I don’t feel that it was in a normal way. How do I know that? Cause I didn’t use to be like that. Emotions, to me, seem to work now like to a BPD patient (perhaps I have BPD traits?). How do emotions work for BPD patients? Simple! Take an emotion X and then square it. A more detailed example: anger(in BPD afflicted individual) = anger\^2. Or perhaps it’s even a cubical function: i.e., anger\^3 (I don’t even remember if cube is exponential 3). Anxiety is writing parenthesis excusing yourself of mistakes in your personal journal entries that no one else will ever fucking read.

Anxiety is looking at your neighbor and running away inside your home for no reason. Anxiety is feeling gutted for dreaming about the people that made you the happiest you’ve been in ages. Anxiety is snapping at those who love you, because you can’t love yourself and everything has a bitter taste to shit. Anxiety is wanting to die, looking at places where you could hang yourself, feeling relief at the thought of no longer breathing, imagining a knife to the throat, thinking about swerving into traffic, travelling, and not feeling anything, kissing someone you’re deeply into and not feeling anything, doubting everything you do, every single cell in your body being inadequate. Anxiety is knowing at a scientific level that something is wrong, but still suffering through it. Anxiety is abusing drugs, anxiety is depression, anxiety is the antithesis of life, of enjoyment, of love and all that’s good. This is “anxiety”, as this is obviously a corrupted, poisonous version of a feeling that’s supposed to help us survive: i.e., anxiety. “Anxiety” turns a survival tool against those who are trying to survive.

I'm currently in therapy, which is amazing that I could even do it, and it's the first therapist that I've ever seen that I feel actually vibes with me, but I'm too scared to ask to try and get diagnosed.

3784,"Regular check-in post, with information about our rules and wikis Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

-----

Our subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.

We also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the ""depression"" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.

YSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:

- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact

- ""I'm here to help"" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.

- Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.

- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).

- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The ""what is depression"" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",1

I have been feeling super anxious and insecure recently about the fact that my partner acknowledges that he has celebrity crushes or finds other women in our life good looking. I don't mean he's asking these people out or he's making moves, I just mean on a surface level. My partner mentions, often enough, that he thinks a girl is good looking or that he finds this celebrity attractive. It really makes me anxious and insecure so I have a hard time hearing this. I know he doesn't mean anything by it, but it's really upsetting me and making me feel so worried all the time that he is going to leave me. Is it normal for guys to do this? Is it normal for people to feel attraction to other people while they're in relationships? I certainly think other men are attractive, I won't lie.

I'm 18 and up until about 6 months ago I was convinced I was completely unlovable. I didn't come from such a great home, and I was bullied for all of elementary school. All I've been told, for all my life, is that I am worthless, ugly, disgusting and just a horrible person. But then I met a guy that made me feel loved, like I deserved to be loved, for the first time in my life. 

We dated for 6 months, then he broke up with me, because I have a personality disorder. I never told him I'm diagnosed with AvPD and BPD, because even though he told me he would always love me, I was afraid that if he knew about my disorders he'd break up with me. Turns out I was right. Because I finally decided to tell him about a week ago, 2 days later he texted me and basically said that he wants to end this. He said he didn't want to be together with someone with borderline. I asked if I did something wrong, but he said he just didn't want the ""drama"". 

I know I didn't do anything wrong, I never did anything to hurt him. But just because I've been through shit he doesn't want to love me. The rational part of me knows he's being an asshole, but the BPD/AvPD part of me wants me to think that *I'm* the asshole. Was he right not to love me? Am I really that horrible?

I feels like i am going to die and this thought didn't let me sleep for 20 days straight in a row. Covid gone but now i got insomnia. I went to bed but didn't get even a single minute of sleep. I got so frustrated, the days was like hell, it was like somebody just take my soul out of body, i don't want to live anymore. Tried melatonin, Vitamin B6 Tablet, Got sunlight daily, nothing works. Then I consult to a doctor. She prescribed me to take clonazepam .25mg for 4 weeks and along to take mirtazapine 7.5mg. Then as per doctors suggestion i stopped taking clonazepam after 4 weeks and continued to take mirtazapine 7.5 mg. It was good for 8 months. I started exercise 30mins daily. Walk for 5 km daily.

3810,"Quick change in anxiety symptoms?! Hi guys,

I've experienced anxiety for a long time now (26F), I'd say at least 8 years. Symptoms have always been tight chest, heart going a million miles an hour, the occasional panic attack. 

I've always managed it quite well, have a decent job and can interact with people fairly well. 

I've never let it stop me doing anything as then I'd feel like it has beat me.

As of 3 weeks ago (it was literally one day fine and the next.. NOT FINE!), I got on the train to go to work and felt like I was going to throw up. My mouth was watering and heart felt like it was in my throat. At first I thought it was food poisoning and something was physically amiss. 

Even though I haven't thrown up and logic would indicate I'm not going to, it feels like I genuinely am on the verge everytime I am in a moving vehicle. 

I thought it would pass, but it's now just part of my everyday life and I'm finding it debilitating. I'm scared I'll lose my job because of it, which is feeding into the anxiety even more. The only way I can get through a train journey (or any moving vehicle for that matter) is by closing my eyes and putting on Bob Marley through my headphones. It's quite comedic but it genuinely is the only way I can slightly manage it. 

I've never enjoyed the commute and have done it for ages, but now it's became a THING. 

I have to have a plastic bag with me at all times as the urge to throw up is so real. 

Has anyone else experienced a sudden and drastic change in anxiety symptoms, how do you manage them? I'm scared I'll be this way forever.",4
3811,"Does anyone find it so hard to get over a comment/criticism to the point they feel suicidal? Trigger warning. Mention of Eating disorders and suicide. 

A month ago my brother was talking about how he just turned 30. He was saying how he didn’t look 30 and he pointed to me and said “he looks older than me”. I’m 24. It felt like a stab in my heart. Ever since I’ve barely left the house. I wasn’t trying to date before that but now I’m not even going to try. I feel suicidal now and I don’t feel like life’s worth living. I’m old looking for my age so I should just give up. That comment is running through my mind 24/7. It’s torture. I feel so embarrassed. 
If my brother knew what that comment did to me, it would suck. I’m so angry but hurts. It’s not really his fault how I feel but why did he say that. I’ve struggled with eating disorders my whole life. I get anxious seeing my brother because I’m scared of what he will say. Everything reminds me of that comment. I have barely been eating. It just reminded me why I shouldn’t leave the house because other people will think the same. 

It feels like such a stupid reason to be suicidal over but it’s taking every bit of my energy not to do it everyday. How am I meant to go through life if a silly comment like that has gotten me like this. How do I get over it? I’m not strong enough to go through life.",3

3813,"Having no romantic relationships or prospects for one is eating away at me I am 24M and have never experienced anything of the romantic kind, not even crushes. I lost my teenage years due to isolation which is usually when people get introduced to this stuff. I've never even had female friends except some cousins.

I live in a culture where arranged marriages are the norm. I'm nearing the age when talk about marriage becomes more serious, especially for women. But I don't see myself ever getting married. I'll probably KMS before 30.

It feels like I will miss out on this part of the human experience because I'm so insecure around women. I saw a post that summarised how I feel perfectly:

&gt;I have trouble talking to women, in fact I can't even make eye contact with them, especially if I find them even a little attractive. I'm scared they'll think I like them and then they'll hate that someone as disgusting as me could like them.

I know that going into a relationship won't fix me but it's so gut wrenching knowing that you don't have the skills or prospects that can make it possible. It's stopping me from even trying to make friends with women, IF they think I like them they'll probably be disgusted by me. (Even though I'm scared to even let myself think that I might like someone)

I know that I should try to make friends with women first, but I'm afraid they might label me a creep sensing my inexperience with talking to women (let alone having female friends or a relationship). It's like I carry this secret with me like a badge of shame and I automatically defer any action about this to prevent myself from the humiliation that will result from it.

Every single day I want to kill myself while at the same time having a panic attack because I don't want to die.

And then I just sit there, not bothering anyone, because no one can look at me and tell me my intestines are silently spinning, no one can look at me and see my heart beating way too fast and know I'm not breathing.

And certainly no one knows that every fucking day while I try to live my life I see myself in a grave not feeling any physical sensation at all, its almost as if I can see the future, almost as if old me is sitting in bed slowly rotting away, dead and no one has checked up on me for several hours

Why tf am I like this, I'm 14, I'm supposed to enjoy life but insead I hate this shit, and I hate living with this terrible anxiety about nothing and everything at the same time, not living because I don't wanna die, which makes me want to kill myself

Like the title said, I'm starting work on my thesis Monday.

My teacher said we'll look into it tomorrow, but I'm panicking. In a few hours, it'll be fixed, but it feels so far away. 

What if there's something wrong and I'm not registered? What if there's been a mistake and I can't start my thesis?

3845,"just realized my carbon monoxide detector is expired and im freaking out ever since i was maybe 10-11, ive had an irrational fear of carbon monoxide poisoning. its gotten better now that im older, but it used to be so bad to the point where i would refuse to sleep some nights because i was convinced that i would die in my sleep from carbon monoxide poisoning, and that i wouldnt be able to hear the alarm going off if there ever was a leak.

i currently have one CO detector in my house (a battery operated one), and its in my living room. i recently read somewhere that CO detectors (at least the first alert ones, which is the kind i have) are only effective for about 5-7 years. i unplugged mine and checked the back and saw that the date of manufacture was march 2nd, 2016, which was almost exactly 7 years ago. although the alarm hasnt given the end of life warning yet. i even tested it to see if it was still working, and it was, although there was no green or red light. dont know if that means its not receiving power, or what, or if thats normal. 

its currently 11pm, so i cant really go out and buy another CO detector right now. im just scared that there will be a leak or something tonight, and that my detector wont go off and i'll die in my sleep, along with my pets. i know its extremely unlikely that there will be a CO leak tonight, but i cant help but think about it. i'll probably buy another detector tomorrow if im able to. im terrified right now. i feel like this is such a stupid thing to be afraid of, and im not really sure why ive been afraid of it for so long. any reassurance would be very much appreciated.

i hope i'll be able to get some sleep tonight.",4

No one takes me seriously when I say that stuff that's happened to me has negatively affected my mental health. I'm basically told to calm down/ stop worrying, even if it's really affected me. Basically just a refusal to accept and acknowledge that I've been hurt.

3850,"New to this. Need coping skills Hello, I am new to this community, but I wanted some help. 

I’ll start with some context. I’ve always been a person that throws up and a lot of the time it was when I was nervous. This past year tho it has gotten much worse, with a time where I even went to the hospital because I hadn’t eaten in like 2 days and I felt so physically exhausted and dehydrated. At first I thought it was from weed and something called CHS, but quitting weed didn’t really make a difference. I also have delt with this vommiting in highschool before I would go to a party I would get so nervous I would puke. And that was before I ever touched weed.

This led me to go to a gastro doctor who said he did not think it was weed related and instead some inflammation in intestines. I’ve been on meds for that for 3 months but it was getting better and I really started to take my anxiety seriously  so I went to my doctor and they prescribed me an SSRI. I also will start therapy in a few weeks here. For the past month (after about 1.5 month on SSRI) I have been doing better. I hadn’t thrown up for a month, but these past 2 nights I have had very panic attack like feelings and tonight even pushed me to the point where I had to get up from being comforted by my girlfriend to throw up. And I always feel awful about it and like it’s going to just keep happening and I think I get stuck in that cycle.

3859,"Seeing some progress but feeling stuck. Hi,

24-year-old male with AVPD here. For some time I have noticed that contacts with other people (in my case only at work) began to bring me pleasure. I've also become more relaxed and when I'm around people I don't worry as much about how they react to what I say. At the same time, a desire for more close relationhips arosed in me. This desire applies both to finding a partner and friends. I just want, as real as never before in my life, a simple conversation with another person and intimacy.

However, I don't know how to achieve this. I've finished my education and I don't have any social hobbies (the gym can be considered as such, but I still can't find a way to start naturally a conversation with other people there). I'm starting to get annoyed with this situation, because certainly something has changed in my attiude and I truly want to form some relationships outside of my work environment. I think I'm ready to get out of my comfort zone step by step, but I don't know how to do it.

One way to do it is to start dating. Finding a partner is something that I want very strongly and I think love is something I'm capable of. The thing that's holding me back from making that move though (other than, well... the lack of photos to use on dating apps) is knowing that I'll be too much of a burden for her not having other relationships. Perhaps there is also an element of shame in not having any friends. I am not sure…

Have any of you reached such a point on your journey to ""normality""? I'm not sure if I'm over-analyzing everything and if I shouldn't just do what I feel regardless of my doubts. In my case, finding friends seems to be something more distant at the moment and I don't know how I could achieve it. However, I will be grateful for every piece od advice!",3

3869,"Life makes me feel so tired You go out into the world because you have to. You spend the whole day trying to muster the energy to be social and push past your social anxiety. You know you still don't have the sufficient social skills or enthusiasm about life necessary to be attractive to women, but you persist with this life anyways, trying to learn what you can from the men you see around you who seem happy, able to confidently express themselves, who bring good vibes, who have something to say, and are interesting. And then inevtiably you look at where you are in life. What you know, what you are like. You are trying to change, but it's not working really. You try to have a real interest and love for things in this world, but it is not coming naturally. Due to whatever mental or developmental reason you constantly forget about the things you try to learn about. Moat of your brainpower is being used trying your hardest to be socially acceptable and not seen as an awkward teenager in an adult's body. Constantly thinking about self presentation and body language, always knowing that it is your outward presentation that largely impacts your opportunities in life.

And at the end of the work day you come home. You are exaughsted, but your job doesn't pay well. So you are supposed to use the time after work to study and work towards a better future. But you feel beaten down and tired when you get home. You can barely muster the energy to work out. If you do, it takes forever because you are tired and you can't focus. And if you are me, a day spent among the socially competent and likable is enough to send you into a negative thought spiral. Googling about how to improve social skills, feeling tired when you read about what you have to do. You are already tired. It is a compounding tiredness. You know it isn't your sleep or your diet. Both of those are in check. It's just life. A life that you are having trouble with feeling enthusiastic about in the first place.

Every day, the nagging thought that you will always be alone is ever present in the back of your mind. You can't stop thinking about those women who you did not have a choice but be attracted to romantically. Not in a very heavy way. They were just someone you actually wanted to shoot your shot with. And you know you failed with these women. And during the time you knew them, you sat and watched as the aforementioned likable, charismatic men of the world easily swooned them, entertained them, freely loved them, and their love was accepted. And you look at that and see that you are not like them. You will never be like those men. You can try every day to painstakingly get there.

You can try as hard as you can to relax and be a fun person to be around, but you never quite reach that state of being. You often wonder if you are not mentally/cognitively capable of being like those men. And you realize that all of this is making you tired still. In addition to feeling essentially doomed to be alone in this world, you are confronted with it's relentless challenges, and you wonder, what is the point of it all? Is this life worth living? Is there a reason to smile when you are the kind of person that you are in this world, and you can't seem to really change despite your absolute best effort, which you painstakingly put in every day, only to return to the same sad, tired state at the end of the day? It's difficult to get excited for life, when you feel socially incapable and generally unlovable. When you feel unable to bring value to other people as a friend, as a companion.

Another day wasted. A day of work is to be followed by a day of work towards a better life, for which there doesn't seem to be any energy. My mind is tortured with the thought that I am not fundamentally a good enough person to be with. This thought never goes away. I will always be alone.",1
3872,"How can I get out of the loop - depression is taking my life away I have been struggling with anxiety and depression for a long time now, and eating disorders in the past that have not fully healed.

The trigger this time was that I saw a photo my broyfriend took of me and my legs appeared enormous to me. That single thought that arised from a photo that a loved one took on me, lead to not eating in three days, self-injuries and an endless loop of feeling like shit. I feel so narcissistic and chidlish, why would my looks be at all THIS important? Still now I cannot get over it. Just seeing my legs in a photo that was taken with love. My boyfriend almost threw me out of home cos I was behaving like a fucking idiotic child.

Yet it is so hard to get out of the loop, I literally have nothing that makes me feel happy and I consider myself to be under the normal for intelligence and I don't have any special skills so I don't see a point in feeling better with myself. I feel so miserable, so useless, I only bring dark stuff to my lovely boyfriend. It's like I know how to get out of the loop (my therapist gave me many tips) but still when I am in the middle I cannot get out, my mind is racing with destructive shit that I believe and I act according to all these thoughts.

The eating disorder has already been on for 13 years and I am already 30. I never imagined at this point of my life I would still be dealing my so many instrusive thoughts and still thinkking this is such a big of an issue.

3910,"Just diagnosed, super confused and scared 21F here. hi all, here we go:

a few months ago, i had my first manic (hypomanic?) episode. It lasted 1-2 months. 

well, after all of the weird behavior, i was urged to see a psychiatrist. and then I was diagnosed.

Ever since being diagnosed and given medication (my first time ever taking daily meds…), i feel somewhat at unease. Even though i have a weird feeling, right now i feel pretty stable and happy. i honestly didnt know medicine could change my life so much. 

But i feel like after experiencing my first manic episode, something in me has changed. Even when im feeling stable, theres some underlying feeling my mood may swing at any given moment. I am still working on finding the best meds for me, so maybe that may have something to do with it?

I dont know. did you guys experience something similar after your first manic/hypomanic episode? Did the underlying unease ever go away?

Sorry if I said anything wrong, i feel like there is still so much i dont know about bipolar. I had a great-aunt who was in and out of hospitals in her 20s for being bipolar, but she was shunned from the family from being addicted to drugs and leaving her kids. Any time i try to ask about her/her bipolar diagnosis, i get shut down. 

I am low-key afraid to google about it. So, all i know really is from what my psychiatrist has told me, which is a lot (with diagrams and everything). It was just a lot to take in.",2

I'm now nearly 30 and I've never held down a job for more than a couple of weeks and have dropped out of a few college courses due to having bad attendance.

3950,"How did you overcome severe gym anxiety? Hello! I'm a gym newbie here, and I've been *really* struggling with going to the gym. 
I have no excuses anymore. I've been telling myself that once I move closer to a gym, once I get a good daily routine in, once I get a job that starts later, so on and so forth... well the stars aligned and I got a gym membership! No more excuses.

Except I've got some sort of gymphobia. I have always felt this way, even went a couple times as a teenager with my dad. I was freaked out then, too.

I went once with my boyfriend right after I got the membership and I wanted to cry the ENTIRE TIME. I was SO self-conscious, to the point it affected my movements. I wasn't focusing on lifting, I was focusing on being quiet, who could see me, how light my weights were, etc. I stared at the clock, couldn't talk louder than a whisper, clung to his side... It was a massive relief to leave and I subconsciously let out a huge sigh the minute the door shut behind us.

Tried going just to treadmill the other day, walked in and went straight to the bathroom because I was so ANXIOUS! There was only one treadmill being used but I was so worried he'd see me trying to figure it out. I got so shakey and almost started crying again so I left the bathroom and went straight home. 

I know for the sake of my mental health I need to overcome this, even if I find out the gym just isn't for me. This is absolutely my anxiety, particularly social anxiety and body dysphoria. What makes me anxious -

- being near other people working out (?!?!)

- seeing my reflection in the mirror

- using light weights (THEY ARE ALL LIGHT so I am just constantly anxious lmao)

- how long it takes me to set up/figure out a machine

- maybe someone else needs what I have and they are annoyed with me

- someone else using what I want and not know what to sub

- anyone talking to me in any capacity lmao

- my form (I'm new so logically I know it'll be incorrect but other people may judge me)

I'm tempted to shell out money for a personal trainer and a therapist. I'm sick of my anxiety and my body as it is, but I wanted to hear yalls advice.

Since this has been causing me so much anxiety forever, and it directly relates to my body dysphoria and anxiety, I feel like overcoming this is going to be a HUGE breakthrough for my mental health. I'd really appreciate your insight.Thank you!",4

I am mostly communicating with my mom and she is so hard to talk to she cuts you off, gets upset if you dont agree and then never understands and so maybe I'm just so incredibly stressed because my subconscious is already expecting something strainous with communicating with her. 

Shes also over communicating like, I'm not getting any continuous space of silence from communication for a good period of time any day of the week.

Previously I was never able to tell that anxiety had built up in me. I would only become aware of it when I blew the lid on something. During COVID, the unfortunate victim became my spouse. I also blew up my relationship with my boss during that time. So once I spoiled the mood around me, or picked up a fight, I would see that things are fucked up. I always blamed the spouse, work or boss for the fight or issues, yet the culprit was mostly my anxiety that slowly built up and got channeled where I had hidden resentments.

It is only during past week that I have finally been able to see the pattern and it is startling. I feel so ashamed and resentful. The sad truth is that I don't see any quick remedy for this either. You see, there will always be some dormant resentments inside me. There are issues between me and my spouse, that we cannot agree on. There will always be resentment which I have how I get treated at work or how I handle more work than the others etc. And whenever anxiety builds up, it needs a channel for relief. I'm afraid my mind will always pick these targets over and over.

I have come to this community to ask for your advice, that what I feel is also how you have felt at some time? I want to take this anxiety and channel it for something constructive. I can't change my spouse, I can't get that promotion. But I can always put effort to find a new job, always choose kindness for my spouse instead of turning things to arguments. How does one make this change? How not being able to channel this energy constructively not become an anxiety in itself too? I need some encouragement and guidance. Thanks",1

Even if you tell someone you're not ok, it just becomes awkward and they will treat you differently and not in a positive way.

I'm so against getting a crown because it involves drilling away healthy tooth structure so that it will fit. It's permanent because tooth enamel can't grow back and so such a procedure I've been constantly anxious about it since the appointment got booked 3 weeks ago. Every day since, I've been dreaded for the day which is tomorrow. Has anyone had similar experiences or currently has a crown in their mouth?

3991,"Feeling Overwhelmed? It takes more to overwhelm some people than others, but the feeling and the impact are the same: overload and not knowing which way to turn next which triggers a downward spiral of anxiety.

### Take these steps to create a plan and go from feeling overwhelmed to feeling peaceful again:

**Identify what you can and can’t control.** List your issues in three columns: what you can control, what you can influence and what is out-with your control.   
 

**Focus on solutions.** Now that you have perspective on what you can and can’t control, identify your chosen end point for each issue. Shift your focus from the problems to the solutions.

**Prioritise your actions.** Consider your chosen solutions in terms of how important they are and how urgent they are. Firstly, deal with the issues that are both important and urgent then move to the other important issues. As a general rule, deal with the important issues over the urgent issues: here-in lies the path to living sustainably crisis free.

**Communicate.** With your plan in place, communicate with those who may be affected: it’s incredible how supportive people can be once they understand your situation.

**Eat well.** Overwhelm commonly leads to skipping meals or over-reliance on junk food. Buy in some healthy foods and snacks to give you the nutrition you’ll need to play your best game.

**Gratitude.** It is easy to lose sight of the good things happening when we feel overwhelmed. Adopt the habit of regularly reflecting on the things you’re grateful for: that you’re taking control of challenging situations, that you’re on your way to calmer times, that you’re learning a lot about yourself, perhaps that others are supporting you.

**Blow off some steam.** Exercise – whatever works best for you: a brisk walk, hit the weights, an hour on the bike – has a magical ability to burn off that anxiety and re-set all those neurotransmitters. It will also help you get that good night’s sleep.

**Get your rest.** Know that you’re focusing on your priorities with a clear plan. You’re pushing yourself hard through the day. A good night’s sleep is the smartest thing you can give yourself to keep working through your list. 

 **Celebrate your successes.** Each step forward is worthy of celebration. Be proud of yourself for taking control and moving forward. Each success leads to further steps forward.  
 

**Overwhelm is a situation everyone is familiar with. Short term episodes are unlikely to harm us. Longer term however, it can be debilitating. Remember there is help out there for those times you need support in getting back on top of things.**",0

I have been prescribed zoloft before but I had the absolute worst adverse reaction to it and has made me terrified to start any ssris. Recently my psychiatrist had prescribed me prozac but my therapist and nutritionist advise me against it as they do not think that my case is that severe. Where I am currently having an issue with is the fact that my biggest fear/ocd trigger is not feeling normal such as the fear of weed and I typically stay away from alcohol as I do not like how i feel when I drink.

I’ve been labeled a “genius”with a 140+ iq for my entire life and now I can’t do basic math. I’m freaking out, it’s so bad I might actually flunk out of school at this rate.

I’ve been on lamictal for years and always knew it made my memory and cognition worse, but it never was that big of a problem because I wasn’t doing anything that hard.

All of that changed this year when I went back to studying computer science in college, something that I was always good at. But now I can’t do anything, and I mean that.

I’m scared of stopping it completely but I want to at least try cutting the dose. My psychiatrist agreed that it could potentially help, but he also pretty much said he doesn’t know much about it. I used take 400 and going down to 200 helped a little, so I’m planning on going down to 100. Has anybody successfully regained some of their brain power by lowering their dose?",2

4022,"Obsessive thoughts about the past Hello.

For about a year, I've been having these obsessive thoughts about the past, all the ways I've messed up and things I did wrong. It's kinda ridiculous; I worry about things that happened 10 od so years ago, and I was just a kid back then, only about 12. I think about newer things too, but especially back then, I was cringy and mean to others for no reason (I didn't like the band that they did. I never bullied them, but I would kinda laugh at them and point out that they're being pandered to. Now I would just turn away and ignore them, I don't know what was up with me back then. To my defense I was almost always the youngest of the group, surrounded by people who were 14-16, from both sides). 

I feel like I'm a terrible human being and that I will be punished for them any day now; I don't know how exactly, by some external force that will come from outside of my home. I'm afraid that people who know me now and are my friends or people I'll meet in the future will judge me so hard and turn away from me. I've deleted every old social media account I could remember, I still make sure that my old emails are active so that I could delete any more if I'll remember. I'm on pretty heavy medications (antidepressants, three doses of synthetic pregabalin and an antipsychotic to quell my anxiety further), and I can function well, but these thoughts still come to me randomly and make me anxious. 

I don't know what to do anymore; My biggest wish is to just move on from that period of my life and close this chapter. On one hand, if someone came to me with thoughts like these, I would tell them that it was so long ago, and they have likely very little to do with the person they were at 13; Besides, everyone was a bit of a little shit at that age. But for some reason, when it comes to me, I just can't free myself; When I get scared, I feel like an ensnared wikd animal, only the snare is just in my head.

I’ve been a major disappointment to my family and it seems like no matter how hard I try, I’m not getting anywhere. I don’t like the thought of harming myself but I’m tired of this life. I can’t see myself living 30+ more years doing this. 

Anyway, I know I need help. I want to try getting on medication but I don’t have insurance. I’m poor af and don’t currently have a job even though for months I’ve been trying to find one that doesn’t cause me anxiety and pays decent enough (one of the main things that makes me a disappointment to my family).

Just posting this in here in case anyone has similar experiences or has had things that help them.

4033,"Thinking about skipping graduation? I am a little sad that I have to post on this sub again. i suffered from depression since high school. When I was in college, I saw a therapist, which really helped. I thought my depression was finally gone for good. But 3 years later (graduating from a community college), my therapist (another one) just helped me realize I still have depression. For a long time, I have mistaken it for anxiety, but depression made more sense. I feel so sad right now, I am dealing with a lot. I know the core of my depression and am fighting it. 

Anyways, my graduation is next month in April, and I don't feeling like celebrating. I don't want to go. I think I am worthless and not worth celebrated for. I think I don't deserve love, I don't like it when my family celebrates me, I just don't feel like it, I don't deserve all that love and happiness. I am scared. it overwhelms me.

I am aware that I am talking to myself very negatively. With everything (job, relationships, school,...) that is happening right now, I can't put more eggs in my basket, I really don't wanna deal with my graduation now, I have too much going on already.

I can't concentrate, I read a sentence out loud but think I don't know it well of won't remember it well enough so I keep repeating it again and again and again and again and it takes way too long. Other study so fast and easily. Why am I so stupid? Why can't I concentrate??? Why the hell am I like that, why is everyone doing so much better than me??!

4035,"My friend expressed that she is disappointed in me. Long story short, I felt tired and anxious and wanted to go home and skip one class. I didn't show up for this class in forever and didn't turn in much work, so she was worried I'd procrastinate like I did in 1 semester and fail.

When I said I'll probably skip again, she looked at me with so much disappointment, and said ""I really should stop caring about people that much"".

It didn't register then, but it hits me now how hurt I am from her words. It feels like I'm not doing good enough, and I probably am not. So that day I forced myself to sit through the class and even showed some progress to my professor. But I can't get the look on her face out of my mind.

To be fair to her, I said I needed to leave in a kinda joking manner because that's my coping mechanism. So maybe she didn't think I felt as horrible as I did and thought i wanted to skip to avoid work.",3
4038,"Lack of opinion and interest in things Anyone else ever feel slow to catch on to things? New show comes out, new game comes out, new trend, im always late to it all. I always find myself saying the phrase “that’s a thing?” when people bring up things I genuinely never heard of but apparently everyone else has

I seem to have a general lack of interest in exploring anything in my life. If 0 is “I hate it” and 10 is “I love this and will skip sleep to do it”, the highest I can get is like a 7. Even with the things I “love”. Which sucks. Because often times people bond thru shared hobbies but you have to be passionate enough about that said hobby to actually fit in. And often times I’m just not that into it as the people around me. 

One simple example is when I tried playing DnD. It just made me uncomfortable because everyone was so into it and I wanted to be as well, but idk it felt like there was this barrier between me and having fun. And I get that it might not be my cup of tea, but like, this happens with everything I try

Or when I was considering my major for school. I ended up picking something that I had just ""heard"" was a highly paid major, without really thinking about it at all. I didn't bother to look into what classes I would be taking, what jobs it would train me for, hell, whether or not I even liked it. It was just ""ok, sounds good"". One of the most important decisions of my life, made in 10 minutes. And now senior year, I'm regretting it heavily and feel like switching to another career.

Makes me think about how many opportunities I’ve missed out on simply for being too average and opinionless in life. Idk

4039,"Chronic stress symptoms Over the past few years - like most ppl - I’ve had a rough time with covid lockdown, plus then I was diagnosed with hiatal hernia, then divorce, and now financial pressures of single-handedly running a household.

I was hoping to put this all behind me but last summer new symptoms started to appear:

+ IBS / GERD (hiatal hernia)
+ Cardiac arrythmias (thousands a day)
+ Various skin complaints
+ Alopecia Barbae (beard patches)

I’ve now had 9 months of all these symptoms and I’ve tried individual meds like beta blockers, PPI, tweaking diet, exercise with no luck… the docs say this is all because of going through  a major life disruption and it’s due to underlying stress. The cardio and gerd stuff is so bad I’ve started avoiding stuff but I have CBT planned as a last resort treatment. Concerned the stress is permanently damaging my health.

Anyone deal with anything similar? Go through a major event and suffer chronic stress? Any of these symptoms? Did they resolve after a time?

She was in rehab and were now a recovering alcoholic and drug addict, but then she called me the other day very drunk and it hurt me so much and made me worried. I sent a message to my family member who has the most contact with her where I said she was drinking again, that I feel really sad and I don’t know what to do, feel helpless, etc. I also sent something similar to my grandpa, because he’s working with her (she lives in a psychiatric apt). Now it’s been days and I’ve gotten no response. I feel anxious and regret sending the messages, they probably think I was on drugs or crazy for sending desperate messages like that, and therefore not responding. I want to unsend the messages but I’m not sure if that would be acceptable to do, or look weirder if I do that.

The last few says have been especially rough. I've been having to drive home in the middle of the day to let our dog out and and give her meds. We have opposite schedules so he usually does those things before he goes to work. I don't always find parking again when I get back from taking care of her either. We adopted another dog right before he left too which I was hesitant to do. In just 3 days he's already needed to go to the vet twice. Once to look at his neuter incision and again later this week for what appears to be allergies or a virus. We have another dog who's been with us since before we got married. She's undergoing chemo treatment but is doing well. I worry about her catching something if he's sick. I've been sleeping on the couch the past few nights to keep him apart from her because she sleeps in our bedroom and he doesn't need to be jumping on the bed.

I was debating asking for weeks, me and my parents have had a strained relationship in the past to say the least, some definitely their fault, some a mix of both of our faults. Anyway, it's left a gap between us that I haven't been brave enough to cross.

But last night I asked them, told them I wasn't struggling with the current allowance it would purely be for an extra nice thing a week to help me get by during these times. IMO they've blown it way out of proportion, they wanted a phone call today to log all my spending and now they're wanting to come and visit me TODAY. It's sending my anxiety haywire this is why I don't open up or ask anything from my parents.

What do I do? Say no to them visiting all together? I'm 100% fine with keeping the current allowance, I just want a yes or a no to have some closure on this conversation with my parents.

What I experience doesn't seem to be consistent with what many other people feel. Before a full blown manic episode I feel great, all my problems melt away and I hardly sleep at all. This makes sense to me. Once I pass that phase, things become very extreme. I can only describe it as absolutely excruciating, like being in hell. Like I'm on a ton of amphetamines and the most extreme anxiety I have ever experience. It never stops or takes a break. I never sleep or even sit down. All I can do is pace around my house all day and night for days on end. My heart is beats out of my chest the entire time. It breaks me and I'll do anything for relief. The last time I was manic, after taking seroquel for a few days, it brought me down to a point where I felt like I was on cocaine all the time. That I could attleat tolerate. 

Does anyone else have horrific manic experiences?? This doesn't seem to be consistent with everything I've read, and it's been bothering me for years. I'd appreciate any input. Thanks!

On a positive note, I haven't had a manic episode for almost a year. 300mg of lamotrigine does a great job keeping me down. Vraylar was very effective as well, but the side effects were more than I could handle. I now take bupropion for depression which almost pushed me into mania once when I was on a lower dose of lamotrigine. Before I was diagnosed, prozac pushed me into the worst manic episode I had ever experienced.",2

I'm so scared that these side effects will never stop and that I have poisoned myself. My chest, arms, and back have been aching and fatigue. I am so sad that I started these because I'm scared this is going to end up killing me. Sites or other reddit users keep using the words poison or ""ruined my life"" etc. I'm jus scared it won't stop. No one will confirm that the side effects stopped after they took them.",4

It’s been a few months since i chose this path and I’ve been strong the entire way through it, until now.

Just got out of a short relationship that was bit toxic for my taste. She was basing our relationship off of shall we say, physical aspects.

I just found out on top of that, she was fucking her ex while we’ve been talking and just yesterday she told me that she believes she may be pregnant by her ex, but it’s too early to take a pregnancy test.

So, I acted normal let the conversation flow as it would over the phone until we finished and, I could not stop thinking about what she had just told me.

Next day i told her we should brake up, we did. She blamed everything on me. I kept my cool, explained how i felt. I was ignored.

So, i created distance so i could heal.


But i’ve come to the conclusion that i don’t want to heal, i just want this to end. Ive never been more ready to end my life until today, not because of the break up, but because of everything. The condition of the world, our future, the situation with my family. Not being able to find and get a place of my own and stuck in a city i absolutely hate.

4116,"Anxiety and Weed Hi, looking for a bit of advice and experiences from r/anxiety here.

Around Christmas I started to develop some kind of anxiety disorder and had a lot of panic attacks. For most of my life I've always been a little anxious and tended to overthink, but these symptoms were just much worse. Up to this point I've also been smoking weed, but not excessively, mostly once a week. After developing said disorder, weed now increases my symptoms, despite it never doing something like this before and it mostly calming me down. Even when I had a greenout, I mainly suffered physical symptoms. 

In response to my symptoms I started with autogenic training, a lot of introspection about my fears and stopped smoking for about a month. With this I got the worst of it under control. Since then I've been smoking a few times with mixed results, sometimes I get more anxious and panicky, but on other occasions it also felt like a normal high. 

Right now I still have some lingering symptoms that can be better or worse, depending on the day, so I'll definitely quit weed until I can resolve this. My question now is, if any of you here have suffered something similar and were you eventually able to smoke without getting anxious again? I'll be honest, I quit enjoyed being high, so that would be quite the bummer, but certainly not the end of the world.

4129,"Storytime... Hey, so... I've made some realizations in the shower as I do what most of us do and plan out the conversations I'll be having in two weeks because I know it's going to happen and I need to be ready or I'll just clam up and nothing is going to happen. We've all been there, most of us are still there, let's talk about what I'm thinking about in this little vent sesh. 

Alright, so I was showering, thinking about how akward it's going to be when I tell my friends some secrets. Wow! I know, sharing secrets! It freaking sucks!

So basically, I'm part of a church group, and these people are closer to me than my family because I don't like/trust my family and being around them is stressful. These friends that I hang out with all the time are my safe place and they make me feel...happy really. 

Though I don't share everything, these people are genuine and kind, and they always make me feel safe. It's just that, I am going on a mission trip with them this summer. Going to Africa, and it took them months to convince me to come with them. I still don't like the idea of going, but knowing that I'll be with them the entire time makes me feel much better. Besides, I used to fly a lot so the plane ride will be pretty nostalgic for me.  

So, as part of going on the trip, I have to do a few things. One thing that I have to do is research a topic on one part of the trip and give a presentation to oir team (9 people including me). I trust, love, and feel safe with everyone on this team, and all but one of them have been my closest friends for almost 2 years now. I couldn't ask for better friends. 

Anyways, the presentation I'm giving is in two weeks and I'll be discussing the entertainment part of the trip. Basically, I just have to research what kind of entertainment there is where we're going and make a small (mostly funny) slideshow. It doesn't even have to last 5 minutes, but honestly...this presentation is the least of my anxieties in this mess. 

Another thing that I'm going to have to do is share my testimony. That is essentially a summarized version of your life story. I'll have to talk about my troubles, my past, my family, all of it. And these are my friends, they'll know if I'm holding back. But it scares me so much! Half of them don't actually know I have avpd! They just know that I've been going to therapy for a while and that I started taking medicine. Though, the medicine is kind of iffy really. 

Anyways, I'm super anxious about it, especially since I did something similar last year, but that was at the height of my emotional suppression. This time last year, I was so empty and emotionless. But of course, nobody knew. I was always masking my emotions and faking a smile. I didn't even know I was doing it, and when I gave my testimony for last year's mission, it was incomplete and full of holes. I talked about my lack of friends, but I was blind to the emotional abuse and neglect from my parents and siblings because I had convinced myself that I was just weak and that my pain was normal and even less than what everyone else had to go through. 

But it's not like that, that's not how I should think about my past pain. It took so long for my friends to break my barriers, but they managed to do that and convince me to go to therapy.

 I'm much better now, but I'm also not suppressing my emotions. It was really hard at first because everything just hurt so much and it overwhelmed me. One moment I was putting on a face to fool everyone into thinking I was okay, but as soon as I was behind closed doors, I was hurting myself and cursing the world for letting my life be the way it was. 

The fact that I have to go and tell my friends how I've been feeling over the last year is overwhelming, but I am not allowed to go on this mission unless I share my testimony. It's only fair though, everyone of us is sharing our testimony, no matter how much it hurts, we're going to be here for each other.


If you've actually read this far, I just want to say thank you. You're a special type of person, and whoever is in your life is truly lucky to know someone like you. And if they don't understand that, then know that I am thanking you for the kindness you have done for me just by reading this. Thank you.",3

As it stands, I already carry a level of anxiety with me, but with this added on to it, my body has been putting me through hell.

Its also occurred at my workplace, the gym, and several other public places without warning.

4132,"I am really, truly screwed this time My parents have decided to stop paying for my food, in the middle of a catatonic depression. I’m scared for myself. I woke up today finally having had enough with starving. I was on my way to the store, for the first time in a month (I’ve only been running low about a week tho), when I got this text from my dad: 

“Do not spend any money at all this week.  Rent is coming out and there is ONLY enough in there for the payment. Unfortunately, you have gone through the remainder of the ‘borrowed money’ from the loans I took out. And you didn’t get a rent discount this year because you filled out the renewal too late. You will have to ask for permission before any new expenses for us to move money into the account.”

I’m backed so far into a corner. I am just defeated. I have no food left, I have no money, and I can’t bear the judgement. It feels like I’ve already lost everything, now they’ve even taken *my food?* I can’t do anything about it in this mental state. They don’t even know I’ve already failed out of my semester and can’t leave my apartment. And my parents are insane. Legitimately delusional and abusive human beings. I mean I’m crazy, but these folks? Who starves their mentally ill son because ‘there’s not enough money’ and then flies to Vegas for the weekend for a vacation? I hate myself but even I don’t deserve this.

This will help ease stress, anxiety and help you be in the moment. Hope this reach as many as possible :) Hi there, so this playlist (available at both Apple Music and Spotify) came to life almost a year ago, when I'd finished researching the effects of listening to nature sounds.

Easily explained:You may have heard about our inherited fight-or-flight response system, which is a major factor in stress and anxiety. Well, research has shown that listening to nature sounds triggers the opposite system, called rest-or-digest, which helps lowering your heart rate, ease tightening muscles and enable you to focus on fewer things. These system is, just like our f-o-f response, is inherited from our ancestors. We believe that reason behind nature sounds triggering this is that hearing birds, rain etc meant positive things for the caveman generations. Birds singing meant that there were no large predators around (as well as good soil), rain meant crops would grow, fire that they would survive the night and so on.

Hope this helps everyone it reaches!

For example today I was trying to talk about something really important to me with my mother, it meant a lot to me because I don’t normally open up. My mother after hearing this went “mm, okay,” and then went on her phone. We were in the car so I held back tears the entire drive home and when I finally got to my room and cried my eyes out.

This has happened a lot as my mother is not a very emotional person. Whenever I open up I think that maybe she will react nicely but this one was the last straw. The fact that she couldn’t even say anything back to me about this thing was appalling and it broke my heart. 

Another person who is frustrating is my brother. I could listen to him talk about video games for four hours straight and have a great conversation but the moment I mention something I want to talk about he goes on his phone and ignores me.

Don’t get me wrong he is way better than my mother but still really disappointing.

I have always been taught to hold it in and never speak about my feelings and it really sucks. I really want goo friends where they don’t mind that I am not very expressive, or they will listen when I am stressed and will let me cry on their shoulder and vise versa.

This might sound really weird, as I've never heard about it here or anywhere else, but I've noticed that when I make a mental effort, especially to learn something new, I seem to change my personality and I can't laugh , I get ""surly"", my mood gets worse.  Also, I get hypervigilant when I see people on the street, I look at them as if I've seen something scary.  If I don't study for a week, my symptoms improve a lot and I become more sociable and relaxed.  ps: Studying means being focused for a period of time on trying to absorb some content well, as mathematics or philosophy, for example.

Last night I had one and this morning when I woke up I almost had one but I managed through it.

So far I've been outside and that helps me but doesn't make it go away fully.

I went to eat at a restaurant and right when I walked it I got panicky and couldn't eat my food because I couldn't hold it down and I had to swallow the 2 bites I did take WITH WATER.

I should enjoy life but ik this is something that will take some time to deal with.

I've been suffering with anxiety and panic attacks my whole life, and while I take a ridiculous amount of meds for it including lorazapam, pregablin etc, I was informed about Magnesium and I wanted to share this with you.

So a lot of us get anxiety attacks triggered by the stress hormone cortisol, magnesium works by by stimulating the production of melatonin and serotonin which boost your mood and help you sleep. Magnesium also reduces the production of cytokines and cortisol, which lead to increased inflammation and stress.

It's important that you don't over do it as you can poison yourself with magnesium, and you also have to make sure it's aspartate, citrate, lactate, and chloride forms as oxide apparently doesn't absorb as well.

Speak to your pharmacist or Dr if you're mixing medication, but I have been able to reduce the amount of lorazapam I've needed since starting mag and its helped a lot with sleep. I'm truly impressed.",4

I know I'm smart, and attractive, and I care for people, but it's my lack of social skills that make it hard for people to see the real me. I've had two guys like me back in the past few years. Which one of them would be considered my ""first love""?

The first guy ""Dave"" I met when I was 19 on vacation. He and I would just talk at the pool about politics and education (even though he was kind of a party guy, he has a nerdy side). We only hung out for two days, but after our first day hanging out, the second day, he was really shy talking to me. But our romance was cut short because he had a girlfriend, and made the mistake of spilling the beans about his crush on me to other kids at the resort. He cut off contact with me, but when they broke up a month later, he started looking at my social media a lot. Not to mention, he made a playlist about me for my birthday. We don't even talk, so I don't know if this is some sort of peace offering or apology. 

The second guy ""Steve"" I met a year later, at my job. He and I bonded on the first day of work about growing up in the same hometown, and I told my mom that day about how we bonded over our ""parallel lives"". We worked together for a little over a year. And we never went out or anything, but he would hit on me a lot. But stupid me was either too dense to realize he was flirting or too surprised in the moment to say any good flirting lines back. But a customer asked me for my number one day, and I gave it to him. I guess I kind of wanted to motivate my crush to ask me out, but literally the week after, he went out with his sister's friend (the sister set them up), but they broke up and he likes me.

4219,"Crazy how powerful thought diaries &amp; breathing techniques have been for my anxiety  I've been undergoing therapy for anxiety and depression for the past two months. My therapist recommended that I start keeping a ""thought diary"" to write down any worries or concerns that I may have and to practice a breathing technique that involves breathing in for four seconds, holding for two, and then exhaling for four seconds.

Initially, I was skeptical that these simple practices could make a difference in something that has troubled me for years. However, I began to notice that whenever I started to become consumed by anxious or depressive thoughts, jotting them down in my diary helped me immensely. This process allowed me to break down those thoughts and identify that 99% of the time, my worries and depression stem from hypothetical situations.

For instance, one of my thoughts was, ""What if my friends are judging me behind my back?"" (for context, this was after we went out for drinks). The key phrase in that being 'What if', meaning it's just hypothetical with no real evidence to back up the worry. So, in my thought diary, alongside my worrisome thought, I would write down a 'Helpful thought' where I deconstruct this worry. For the aforementioned thought, my helpful thought was:

""This is a hypothetical worry, you have no evidence to suggest this will happen. Your friend's opinion of you shouldn't be taken seriously anyway. You don't need to seek approval from your friends.""

Of course, this may not help everyone, but I wanted to share how thought diaries have helped my mental health, and they can be quite powerful.

 TL;DR: My therapist recommended keeping a ""thought diary"" and practicing breathing techniques to help my anxiety and depression. Writing down my thoughts and using the breathing technique has helped me identify that 99% of my worries are hypothetical. I recommend trying it out.",4

4231,"Does anyone feel like they’re on the edge of a cliff of being content/happy, and one small thing could make you fall off? Don’t really know how to explain this further. Throughout my life I’ve been tortured with medical issues and a dysfunctional family and so on and so fourth. This made me able to “resist” depression if that makes sense. I could, essentially, ignore it. I could force the happiness through and suppress anything else.

Little things have made me happier than normal over the last five months, including someone I thought was my friend, until it became obvious that likely isn’t the case. Before this I had entire, fantastical and delusional ideas about what the next few months could look like between us.

Things are getting worse between my family too, and now I’m dealing with a shitton more responsibilities that will likely be falling on me within a few months from now. That and this crumbling relationship (only friendship, and the farthest one has ever got for me) are starting to push me to the end of the line. I’m finding myself randomly breaking down more often and I feel like, unless something drastic happens, I’ll explode.

The best visual representation of this (it’s fairly stupid and niche, I know) is a scene in Umbrella Academy 3 (ep 7, trying not to spoil anything) where a big problem was averted, then this was celebrated, and then the crisis comes back with more ferocity than before in an extremely short amount of time.",1
4232,"Never talked to somebody Hello everyone, I'm slowly losing touch with reality. I don't know if it's important, but I've been diagnosed with depression and social anxiety since 2018, when I was hospitalized for six months due to burnout. Since then, I don't know if I'm truly happy or just pretending unconsciously. I started dating my boyfriend in 2019, but we broke up in late 2021 when he cheated on me with my best friend's ex-girlfriend. It was the first time I lost control over my actions and thoughts. I was sometimes treated as the perpetrator, even though I was just existing. In that state, I stopped eating and felt no energy to nourish my body, and even when I tried, I couldn't. I was on the brink of doing something stupid, fully aware of how foolish it was. Thankfully, I ended the relationship. I distracted myself with friends, some of whom were also going through breakups. I learned that alcohol could help me cope with my social anxiety, at least for a few hours, where I could enjoy the happy feelings without overthinking. I did this for about 10 months almost every weekend with friends, and it helped me try new things and gain new experiences. However, I always had a nagging feeling that grew into a thought. As I try to be the motivator in the group and the ""funny person,"" I feel like my problems are underestimated externally, and I'm becoming lonelier each week. I realize that I couldn't confide in anyone with all my thoughts. I always talked about my problems objectively but never let myself break down because I felt it would be too exaggerated and too intense. Now that I miss those weekends, I feel more isolated every week. I also have other things that bother me at home, making it hard to feel comfortable. My parents also only understand depression as a common cold that should be cured after hospitalization. I don't know what to do anymore; I feel like a stone.",1

I have had quite a lot of awful things happen to me in the last 10 months, which most of which I reconise is entirely my fault. I had a miscarriage and was very horribly assulted by a man which caused me to spiral, develop an eating disorder, take far too many drugs and drink too much, cheat on my love of my life and break up with him, I got sober and became friends again with my now exbf and I did a lot of healing and (now have ) celebrated 200 days sober. It had been about 5/6 months and me and my ex boyfriend at the time who were incredibly close (after I got sober) despite all the arguements and it became a bit of a situationship and we then got back together. We were together for 2 and a bit months and it was really very wonderful apart from maybe two problems and he was still healing from my betrayal, which I will always carry the guilt. He then broke up with me around 5 weeks ago and I am at my whits end. I have a 6 week thearpy course I paid for which will end in two weeks. I have now gotten it in my head I am deserving of all my guilt and pain, which I am for most of it DEFO - I am not looking for sympathy dw - but I have convinced myself walking around today that the next earth shattering or heart breaking thing I will walk into traffic or try and end my life in a way that makes it looks accidental so no one has the burden.

Music was my life, I was part of jazz music programs inside and out of school , wind orchestras, scored perfectly on all my NYSSMA performances ( New York State Music Association) even skipped a few levels because I was advanced. And part of All County band programs(a hand selection of students to be part of a large bad group that would perform in front of 100's of people). I then moved on to get a scholarship to a music college, I however decided to join the army instead and became a profession musician for them for 8 years, performing for presidential speeches, Veterans day and St.Patrick day parades in NYC, played half time shows at NFL games etc. I used to love just sitting at a piano and letting the music flow through me, sure I wasn't the best in the world, but the raw emotion I put into my music was just a feeling I can't even explain, now it's been over 4 years since I've touched sn instrument and I just feel so empty about it.

The degree that I have was more theory based and I really need hands on experience to be employable in my field, which I now have the opportunity to do alongside guaranteed internships and portfolio work. 

My stress levels are currently through the roof about this, as I am worried that I won't be able to match the calibre of current high school leavers, who, even though treated as adults at University, still seem to have that high school mentality. My main issue is, even though not permanent, the dorm style accommodation and the fact that an ""old"" person is living with basically a teenager, although I did apply for a single room with a shared bathroom, so maybe not so bad. 

Usually I wouldn't have a problem with this, but already having experienced this with not much success, I am now stressing immensely. I'm not there to be anybody's friend, but the way I have been treated in the past, just for being a little older has been disgusting. There is not much available accommodation at all in the country, so looking for anything else is currently out.

4267,"What If You’re Doing Better Than You Think? It’s not unusual for a person to think they’re doing worse than they actually are. Some of us are pessimistic, others have limiting beliefs lurking: I’m not good enough, I’m not worthy – progress is just luck, setbacks re-enforce limiting beliefs.

### Consider these positive signs:

· **You reflect on, and learn from, setbacks and errors.** You arrive at a balanced view of these and develop clear plans to learn and continue growing. People often repeat the same errors over and over, whether it’s overspending or choosing a partner. People have a strong tendency to repeat their behaviours. But you can choose to respond differently – and achieve different outcomes

· **You’re clear on what you want – and why.** Knowing what you want is the second key step in getting it (knowing who and what you are is the first). Knowing what you want differentiates you from those who aimlessly floating through life.

· **You use time wisely.** We all have 168 hours each week and the choice on how to use them. You focus on what is important, within the context of who you are and what you have chosen to achieve. You have the habit of asking yourself what is the most effective thing you could be doing right now. 

· **You’re making consistent progress.** Consistent progress is a great sign. Even when your goals feel far in the distance, regular progress – driven by consistent effort and learning – will get you there. As well as planning what more needs to be done, reflect on how far you have already come.

· **You’re not alone.** There are many people are alone in the world. If you’re not alone, you’re doing better than many others.

· **You’re committed.** You know who you are and what you’re about. Your goals are clear. They create meaning for you, value for others and legacy for the future. Great things happen when your purpose and your environment align.

· **You consider other’s opinions.** You learn what is resourceful to you and discard what isn’t. You live your life, not theirs. 

· **You are grateful.** You regularly reflect on what has gone well and – crucially – on why it has gone well. You have skills and strengths you don’t even realise.

· **You’re authentic.** You know you values and beliefs. You make your decisions and take your actions consistent with these.

When you’re clear on what you have chosen to accomplish, and you’re spending your time wisely, you’re doing well – and better than most! This is true, even if the results have yet to reveal themselves.

**Genuine Desire + Effective Strategy + Consistent Persistence = Authentic Results**",0

That combination bought me a month of euthymia, A FUCKING MONTH before it started to go to shit again. My mood started to decline for NO FUCKING REASON. My life was going perfectly, BUT FOR SOME FUCKING REASON MY MOOD STARTED TO DECLINE. I decided to go off Lamictal because of the brain fog, and because it wasn't helping at that point. Eventually, I went off of olanzapine because of the fatigue. Replaced it with quetiapine but that didn't do shit. Got hospitalized because my depression was getting out of control, I went out with hope for the first time. I got discharged on January 28th, wasn't really doing well but I was hopeful, by February 8th all that hope AND MORE was crushed. Attempted suicide, and spent another 3 days at the hospital but refused to get admitted to the ward again because they were completely fucking useless. Couple of weeks later had a mixed episode because quetiapine wasn't working for me like olanzapine was. My life was completely beyond repair after the episode, completely over. Just completely over, no way it was ever getting better after that. Went back to olanzapine and here I am.

As I said, my life is over. This illness has defeated me. It's been a month and it hasn't gotten any bit better. My mood chart looks like a flat line, I haven't had a single mood that wasn't awful in the past month and a half. No one cares, people don't care that they've hurt me. Everyone has moved on, but I'm here. I don't know why I'm here, like I said, it's over. I cry myself to sleep whenever I can. I avoid almost everyone except for a few close friends who don't even know what I'm going through. I don't want to tell them because it just ruins everything. I believe all people are inherently assholes, its in our nature to be selfish. I deserve to suffer like this, not because Im me but just because im human. Every human deserves this and more. 

Even if I were to get better, I would still be awful. My doctors and I have practically given up on trying to treat my anxiety because I don't respond well to the medication(obviously SSRIs induce mania). It's over. It's over. It's over. It's fucking over",2

4328,"Stress and your body's endocannabinoid tone Stress can be classified into three common categories:

* Acute stress
* Episodic acute stress
* Chronic stress

&amp;#x200B;

**Example of Acute stress and your body's endocannabinoid tone:**

Acute stress is a short term physiological response to a situation that could be a challenge or threat.

The sensation usually lasts for up to 30 minutes and the experience is usually linked to a one-off or infrequent occurrence.

For example, acute stress could include your body's reaction to:

* An approaching deadline
* Completing a challenge or receiving an award
* Narrowly avoiding being hit by a car
* Rising on a rollercoaster or fairground ride

When your body responds to acute stress, it releases various hormones, including cortisol and epinephrine.

Together cortisol and epinephrine prepare your body to respond to the danger by giving your muscles an immediate supply of glucose, narrowing blood vessels and increasing heart rate.

Studies have found that endocannabinoid tone directly affects the level of cortisol and epinephrine and provides greater control over them during times of stress.

For example, people with a naturally high endocannabinoid tone experience a smaller heart rate increase during a stress response than those with a lower tone.

This is likely due to the endocannabinoids exerting a modulating influence over the release of hormones.

This was verified in 1993 when research scientists found that people with a medium or naturally high endocannabinoid tone secreted less cortisol.

This could indicate that people with a naturally high endocannabinoid have a less intense physiological response to acute stress.

&amp;#x200B;

I (20F) was diagnosed with BD2 back around October, so still fairly recent. I am super lucky to have a family that encourages me to keep going to therapy and stay on medication, however I’m finding  they don’t really *understand* what I’m going through.

While I’m aware there’s no real way for them to conceptualize what is actually happening to me during hypo episodes more specifically (was misdiagnosed w depression at 17, depression I feel is a little easier understood) I’d like to be able to have them be aware of what an episode is like. I can’t exactly put it all into words when trying to explain it to them myself, and I often feel like doing that ends up scaring/worrying them more.

But recently, my hands started to itch again. Slowly. I take my antihistamine in the evening, I'm fine all day long the following day, and then in the evening it starts to itch again. My overall skin as well. 

I'm worried I will have to stop taking my Lamictal. It has been wonderful. No side effects whatsoever. If I stop taking it, I won't take any other medication because I don't want to gain weight, or hurt my kidneys. 

Have any of you gone through something similar? With allergies? I talked to a pharmacist when I started doing this and they told me I couldn't become resistant to antihistamines. I'm starting to doubt this...",2
4352,"I’m In Pain I will admit that I’m a bit of a hypochondriac and have a lot of anxiety surrounding my health, but I’m experiencing something I’ve never gone through before. Since Sunday evening, my whole body has been in extreme pain and I just have that feeling I get when I’m sick with something like a cold or the flu. But those are my only symptoms. I’ve had 2 negative Covid tests and just got a negative flu test from the doctor where they also did some lab work and gave me a prescription for my pain. 

The only other explanation I can think of for the cause of this is that I got extremely depressed and stressed out last week. I’m not new to stress or depression though, and I’ve never had this type of reaction before.

Just wondered if anyone had any ideas or has experienced anything like this.  I’m worried this is all in my head even though my pain feels very real and severe, and it doesn’t seem to be letting up at all.",0

New year, new hiring season, but I’m still here…in my room…applying for jobs…almost 50-100 applications sent a week, but because I’m not specialized in anything, I have to wait for handouts.

The doctor prescribed me Enlift , Xanax and Magnesium (which I've heard good things about it in this subreddit). Ive only ever been prescribed Zoloft, tried it for about 3 months and it didn't work for me so I'm basically going in blind. 

The doctor told me some basic instructions as well as explained how they work but it doesn't ease my anxiety about them, especially Xanax.

I know medications like these aren't a one-size-fits-all but I think it would ease my anxiety to know some of your guys personal experiences with them.

It’s become a negative cycle spanning years and I never seem to get better. It’s decimated my self esteem and riddled my life with stress and anxiety, and of course imposter syndrome in every professional situation with any decent level of responsibility.

Over the past few months I've experienced my first full-blown manic episode, with all the characteristic symptoms. 

Now I'm back in a really bad depressive state. Nevertheless, I've really been treated like shit over the past few months by some people who were once friends. In the past, I'd have been very meek and mild and probably would have let such behaviour slide. But over the past month or so, I've been very confrontational about the way I've been mistreated. 

I also went to the annual general meeting of a society I used to be president of, and called them out for their causal homophobia, misogyny, racism etc. 

These are things I wouldn't have considered doing in the past - I'd have been far too anxious and frankly conflict avoidant. Now that fear has gone and I see willing to embrace confrontation when I've been wronged.

I have managed it all this time with no medicine, and I have been fine with for the most part. The only time my anxiety would rise a little bit is when it was triggered by stress. Which then I knew I just had to balance it out again.

Well, this month ended up with heighten anxiety due to an allergic reaction being around seafood, one week later got a tooth pulled, 2 days later I was fussed at by an ER doctor, and then one week later after that I had anxiety reflux kick back so hard that it cause two days of back to back panic attacks. My anxiety was so bad that I couldn’t eat anything but rice and chicken, no meds, and being around doctors frighten me. I couldn’t manage to get myself out of that anxiety loop. 

Well I was finally about to get some hydroxyzine  for “as needed dosage” 3 weeks later. My anxiety was down back to a manageable level but my fears were still there. I took one 25 mg pill in the evening. I got an euphoria feeling and drowsiness the whole next day along with diarrhea. Then all my anxiety was gone. I can eat food again without fear. I’m not scared to take meds again. 

This is the weirdest Anxiety is the moment I have ever dealt with. However, I’m now pondering if with my anxiety reflux being kicked up it had my stomach and brain a relay lap so when I took the hydroxyzine it suppressed that nerve in my stomach and it help my stomach feel better and then which stop the relay cycle.

+ IBS / GERD (hiatal hernia)
+ Cardiac arrythmias (thousands a day)
+ Various skin complaints
+ Alopecia Barbae (beard patches)

Up to the surgery i was a mental wreck more than before. Now after the surgery ive been Well for the most part. I have had alot of fears after that actually got worse over the two years instead of better. Now to start This story up we gotta rewind a few months, its a few days after Christmas, im at granny inlaw having a good time, when My  girlfriend notice My right ankle is a little swollen above the achilles tendon, we call the emergency eoc and he wants ud to Come in, he frels it and want it scanned with ultrasound. It was fine. Now i didnt Think much of it then, but im sure My ankle above the achilles always was swollen but i havent ever really looked much at My ancles.
Now here is where it gets difficult two days later we Are home, i wake up and notice i have a coin sized point bit left from My sternum with minor pain,and I get spells of dizziness.
At night i get admitted to the ER and they do ultra sound, ekg, bloodwork work etc. And everythings fine, except from slightly elevated troponin which could be scar tissue, though they think i have a minor infection in my heart and release me sayinf i should be fine sfter some time but i dont feel fine. Onde home i get This feeling  of not being able to get enough air when I breath. A week later im back in the ER, they do the  usual checks plus a ct and guess what, im fine except for the same slightly elevated troponin and they release me Again sayings its just a minor infektion. 
3 weeks later i have an appointment with a specialised cardiologist that is educated for valve disease and has byen following me for over a decade. She checks me and im fine My heart is in a good condition. Now i didnt feel happy when told so, but extreme dissapointment, i started to get a feeling of fear of Them having made a mistake or missed something . The reason being is that before My surgery the hospital i was in the ER at, didnt see that My heart wasnt doing Well when I was in for chest pain(wasnt a heart attack, but My valve failing badly) the Same pain i have Now. 
Now i startede going to a psych every third week and its good. But at this point im uncertain of what is wrong, ive been checked at the hospital 3times and at a specialized cardiologist, and they havent found much that could explain the pain.

My grades have lowered, ive stopped going to school and instead i cyber and just cheat on all my courses because it’s easier than focusing. I got out of bed, i didnt nap all day. i was in therapy, but i was getting better and only had episodes around once a year. They happen a few times a month.

4458,"Switching meds, planning pregnancy, and moving across country. Recipe for disaster? For context I have type one and a history of 4 hospitalisations in 7 years. ECT (worked amazingly but only for a while), tried loads of medications and it seems like we've finally found a combo that works. I haven't had a serious episode for over two years now. 

I have a two year old son and, despite the manic episode I had after four days is labour when he was born, he's the best thing that has ever happened to my mental health. I love him to bits even though he was a surprise and I was totally sure I wasn't ready.

Now my husband and I want a sibling for him. We both never had siblings of our own, so he has no cousins and we both wish we had siblings. We want a baby sooner rather than later because the age gap keeps getting bigger. 3 years difference is ok, but 4 seems like much more to me. I don't know. I've started taking folic acid and we should be ready to start trying to conceive in May. 

We also happen to be moving across the UK for my husband's work in July. If all goes well, I could be pregnant by then.

I told my psychiatrist this and he told me that my antidepressant, clomipramine, is dangerous to the baby in pregnancy and can cause serious heart defects. He wants to switch me to an SSRI (citalopram), which I've tried several of and they haven't done much for me in the past. Clomipramine worked for me I think because it's also effective in OCD and while I don't have OCD, my depressive thoughts are definitely obsessive. I've been taking clomipramine for since a mild depressive episode I had a year ago and since I haven't had any depression at all and I haven't gone manic either.

I'm just worried with the move (even though I'm really looking forward to it) and the pregnancy and the medication change might be too much. As a mother, I feel having a serious episode is not an option, but then am I just putting more pressure on myself? Is this crazy? Should I try it or wait another year with the baby? Even just changing medication worries me, but I can't consider pregnancy without doing that first.

I don't know exactly what I'm asking for here. Reassurance? Sanity check? Advice? Any and all of that is welcome.",2

Recently had a girl message me on Tinder and the conversation went really well/flowed really naturally. She suggested we meet up, and considering how much I've progressed recently, I figured I wouldn't give myself enough time to reconsider/doubt myself and just said yes.

I was pretty chill for the most part, but my nerves got the best of me once there were only two hours left before the date, but it still wasn't nearly as bad as it would've been before.

The date went pretty well. I was pretty nervous, but nothing that was overwhelming. We walked and talked a bunch, went to a small art exhibition, grabbed some ice cream and then I had to leave.

Overall a very pleasant experience despite the nervousness. I would have neeever in my life had thought that I'd be able to go on a tinder date fully sober. In the past I had to get blackout drunk (+other drugs) to even text people on Tinder, so I'm very very very glad I had the power in me to not cancel or chicken out and actually go through with this, even if nothing might come of it.

I have a question, my partner has AVPD. We have been dating for some months.

And I noticed that when he’s going through an anxiety “episode” or moment. He sort of physically avoids me.

For example if he feels embarrassed, or has low self esteem particularly high that moment. He will “hide” behind his laptop, or walk behind or in front of me, distancing himself physically, while still being kind, it’s more of a way of hiding from me, when he can’t actually leave. (For example when we share a hotel room on vacation)

I did notice that when I grab his hand to hold mine while walking, that he does reciprocate(even when he tried to walk behind me or further away from me) but I’m not sure if he does it to please me but dislikes it, or if he likes it that I’m gently being reassuring and consistent.


My dear Avpd-Ers- when feeling low, do you like being comforted, or do you truly want someone to take distance and leave you alone? I just want to learn how to handle the situation so he feels comfortable!

I drink my coffee in about 5 minutes, then I read a book for an hour, then I listen to music and surf the web for a non-specific reason. Everything has to be done very fast, and well-planned, if not, I get impatient, irritable, and anxious.   
It's pretty exhausting and I realized it's a problem going on for two years now. I did not pay too much attention to this before, since I didn't even know there was a term for this condition. 

Does anyone else experience something similar? How are you dealing with it?",4
4492,"My future feels so hopeless. I'm 28 years old, my resume is useless, haven't worked in 2 years, and I am very avoidant of the world Hi there. I have been depressed since I was 12 years old. I am now 28. I also struggle with BPD, social anxiety and Avoidant Personality Disorder, afraid to leave the house by myself, reliant on my 66 year old mother to pay my medical insurance, and my husband is working full time barely keeping us afloat. I have tried and tried to work. Several different fields. Even part time. It always ended up in burn out and felt more depressed and anxious so I had to quit. I am worried, I feel my future is really hopeless. I love my husband so much. We wanted to have a family and it's feeling like that won't happen because of my mental health and the low money thing. I am afraid he will abandon me because of all this though deep down really don't feel like he will because he has been here through everything.

I know that is so much. That is definitely something to be grateful for. But we fight a good bit because we're both so stressed out.

Nothing really brings me happiness except substances, (and that leads to bad feelings when it wears off or sometimes when on them) and I've been mostly sober for a year.

I see a therapist. I take medications. I just... I am not content in life. I am constantly worried about everything. I constantly feel like I'm worthless and my husband deserves someone more stable that he doesn't essentially have to be a caregiver to at times. I stay in bed about 70% of my days because I feel like things are so hard to do and feel so pointless.

I don't have many friends and live in a small town, so there aren't any meetup groups or anything. And since I don't work and am not in school, no opportunities to make many friends. I do have one so I can try to branch out with her friends maybe. It feels like life is just about working. And I feel so depressed by the state of everything, and by my worries that things won't improve in the future.

Things don't get better. Not if you don't work for them. And I have worked, I've tried so many treatments, but the one thing I rarely do is go out in the world.

And I don't know if I can do that without a lot of help that I don't know if I can find.

Please if you can relate at all, or have any advice, please please respond. &lt;3 I'm desperate.",3

I have no friends much less a girlfriend, I used to hang out with my school friends (till about 2019) but nowadays all of them have moved on with their lives, at University I made no friends the first 2 years and now is impossible because everyone already knows each other so there is no ""get to know each other"" moments. 

Not only that, but because I fucked up so many times at University I lost access to the government grants and I must pay for University with my money which I don't even have because I don't have a job but even if I had one it wouldn't be enough.

I don't do anything the whole day nor do I talk with anyone, I haven't had a conversation with someone other than my family for about 3 years. I'm only eating once a day because I'm short on money, I hate going outside because I don't have anything to do but I can't even watch a movie or play a video game because is just not fun anymore, I often just keep opening and closing the movies or games.

Most of these bad things are related to my relationship with the people around me. I'm constantly thinking that they have something against me or they're betraying me. This started last year, 2022 after the restriction, because of the pandemic, loosened. I had a group of friends that I was with  and had a few drinks together, had fun, and typical stuff you do with your friends. After a fee months, I felt something was wrong. Even though they are not showing it, I feel it that they don't like me. I confronted them about it, and they said ""no"". But few days after that, someone told me what they've been saying about me. I felt betrayed and sad. After that unfortunate incident, I've been having trust issues and I trust my intuition more than ever. 

Now, I'm talking to someone. He's sweet and gentle. He works hard and is independent. He talks to me even though he's tired, I really feel that he's someone to keep. But today, I just felt that something's wrong. He called me but he didn't speak. I called him back but didn't answer. I texted him what's wrong, if he's okay. He answered me ""yupp"". That was it, not even an explanation. I don't know if I should tell this guy that what he did triggered my anxiety, and I suddenly felt that he's unto something. I don't want to think much about it because I actually like him. 

Should I tell him after his shift or I should keep it to myself and see what the future holds for me?",4

I love Amy.  I want to support Amy the best I can.  But the amount of emotional support she is asking for is starting to drain my own mental health resources for staying stable.  Additionally, Amy makes a lot of comments about our experiences being the same and she “gets what’s it’s like for me now” when she very clearly does not.  She is not making these comments from a place of ill intentions.  I know mental illness is not a contest and mental health treatment is important for everyone.

I knew that from the beginning but hoping to please and attempt to make her proud of my accomplishments she would just say ""Why do I need to say I'm proud of you? You have to be proud of yourself""  It's been an ongoing toxic loop so I always distance myself or not contact her, however since last week she's been living with me and we have been bickering here and there.

 ""You don't need to push yourself. It's okay.""

 ""I know you have some family troubles right now but I can see there are good people behind you. Really good people""

It was such a confusing experience because she was smiley nice in her 50s lady. 

Can someone tell me if she was a hypnotist or if she can see my soul or some angels or if she was just an empath that knew I was extremely stressed and wanted to let me know I was stressed.

4560,"AI, and the devaluation of humanity I’ve been thinking a lot about AI recently. The explosion of Chat-GPT, Midjourney, DALLE-2….someone with zero writing or art skills can spend 3 seconds coming up with a prompt and generate something incredible. Something a human would spend hours or even days coming up with. And it’s accelerating faster than we could have imagined. AI voice spoofing, AI generated images of celebrities and politicians, plagiarized college essays…these things were unimaginable 6 months ago. 

All this gives me anxiety and not just because I’m a writer as my profession. It’s devaluing human talent and creativity - everyone can now do it, therefore it means nothing. Over-saturation renders everything meaningless. And the irony is that humans made this tech that is now outshining all of us…and will ultimately do everything better than we can.

This is a pivotal time in humanity and I am not ready for it and I don’t think anyone is really ready for it. Everything from the way we work to the way we consume media will be completely upended by AI. 

I just want to rewind 20 years and live peacefully. I don’t want all this change. And it’s filling me with anxiety, hopelessness and dread.",4

4563,"Why does nobody talk about “high-functioning” stress? I’m the type of person who is constantly under stress but doesn’t realize it until I develop a nonstop eye twitch, my menstrual cycle is erratic, get a cold out of nowhere, migraines, etc. I’ve talked to my therapist about this and he’s acknowledged that it’s definitely a thing- some people are just so used to being stressed that they don’t notice a difference when they’re in a more high-stress situation until their body breaks down. 

The problem with high-functioning stress is that not only are people not aware that they’re stressed, but they don’t know how to handle it before their body sh*ts the bed. Ex: I feel fine (when I’m not) until a trigger happens and I’m left with an eye twitch and a random cold- which is THEN when I’m like “oh, I’m super stressed”, despite having been in a high-stress environment for a few weeks already and feeling the same.

Does anyone else relate? I know I could try meditating or mediating my underlying stress but it feels useless when you don’t feel stressed in that moment (and have a million other important things to focus on- ironic).",0

I started my first this job September of my last semester of college, and I was excited to have such a great opportunity. 

From day one, I have felt very little direction at the job. I had one day of training on one of the four projects I was to oversee. The previous person in the position had left already and I was trained by someone filling in for the moment. The training I got doesn’t even scratch the surface of all that I have to do. There’s so many things don’t know how to do or didn’t know I was supposed to do. I’ve read through my manual for help and there’s not enough information. 

It seems me asking for help from my colleagues is unwanted, and something is not clear between me and my bosses. It’s like the expect me to know things I was never shown. I’ve only been trying to learn the system for 7 months (which I do understand better now). 

I feel trapped and punished. I don’t reach out, then will always be lost. I reach out and it’s a surprise. 

This my first “legitimate job” and I can’t tell whether or not I’m not good enough or if I was put in a bad situation. I want to like my job, but I honestly really dislike it due to never knowing completely what I’m doing. I have no help…and I’m on edge everyday thinking about my job.",4

4569,"Help I am 27 (M). I am married and I have an amazing, loving and supportive wife. However, I am divorced. My ex-wife hurt me pretty bad, but not how most people would think. She had two sons and I happily raised them as my own (#1) and things were great. One day, she made the suggestion that I should get a vasectomy because neither of us wanted more children and we were both completely happy with our lives at that point. She didn't force me too, but I did it. I trusted my wife. I got the procedure (#2). Fast forward, one day, I find my wife in my bed with another man, such decency.

We divorce, I lose everything, as most men do. I lose my wife, I lose my children (that I raised from infancy, but aren't biologically mine, so I have absolutely no rights in the state I live in and I have never seen them since the day she left). 

I get married, I tell my now wife up-front about everything. She loves me anyway. I can't shake the feeling of what I have done to myself. To take it steps further, I work in child welfare. Everyday, I see people who have children and they piss it away. I would give anything for that opportunity. I paid thousands for a reversal and it wasn't successful. I've never been a suicidal man and I've never felt any panic type emotions until all of this hit me in the face.

Everything I have done to myself. I know life isn't over, but I now have to face the reality that I could quite literally die alone... And I am 27. I've tried medicine, I've tried exercise, I've tried counseling, for months. Nothing shakes this feeling of emptiness. I feel like I was set up and robbed, but what was taken was worth much more than money. I don't know who to call, I don't know where to turn.. I'm not even sure if this is the right place to be but.. I know my wife loves me. I just don't love myself anymore. I feel like the stupidest and most naive man to have ever lived. I trusted my wife. 

Most 27 year olds, you know, they do stupid things. I've thought about suicide but not because I don't want to be alive. My parents just think I was stupid for ever making that decision. All I can respond with is, ""Yeah, I was pretty stupid."" And that's it.

4622,"How to deal with in-person avoidance? Hi dear community!

I have a question, my partner has AVPD. We have been dating for some months.

And I noticed that when he’s going through an anxiety “episode” or moment. He sort of physically avoids me.

For example if he feels embarrassed, or has low self esteem particularly high that moment. He will “hide” behind his laptop, or walk behind or in front of me, distancing himself physically, while still being kind, it’s more of a way of hiding from me, when he can’t actually leave. (For example when we share a hotel room on vacation)

I did notice that when I grab his hand to hold mine while walking, that he does reciprocate(even when he tried to walk behind me or further away from me) but I’m not sure if he does it to please me but dislikes it, or if he likes it that I’m gently being reassuring and consistent.


My dear Avpd-Ers- when feeling low, do you like being comforted, or do you truly want someone to take distance and leave you alone? I just want to learn how to handle the situation so he feels comfortable!

4632,"Does anyone else ever ""live vicariously"" through other people's social media? Sometimes I find myself going through people's Facebook profiles - usually it starts with someone I'm ""friends"" with, then one of their friends, then someone tagged in one of their photos and before you know it I'm looking at this totally random person's life. And I'm seeing all the good times they've had, the relationships, the weddings, the vacations.

And it makes me wonder if I could have been their friend, or if I could have been doing those things with them. Sometimes I'll think back to what I was doing at the time the post was made or the photo was taken and find myself comparing my empty life to theirs. 

It makes me feel like shit and yet I can't stop doing it.

Does anyone else do this?

I don't think it's really the traditional ""FOMO"" that people often feel when engaging in social media posts because I'm not sad about other people doing something without me *right now* so much as a broader envy of their life in general. It's not envy of someone posting pics of their nice car or fancy hotel room on Instagram; it's not the heavily curated, photoshopped influencer stuff. It's envy of people who went backpacking with friends one summer in college. It's envy of people watching the Super Bowl together.

4652,"Nobody takes an interest in me, so I stopped taking an interest in myself For as long as I can remember, all my friendships have been due to me taking the initiative. Asking the other person about their life and making plans. If I stop doing this, I stop having friends. 

I wonder what this says about me. The only thing that comes to mind when facing this fact is ""Am I that reprehensible?"". And I know that sounds like I am expecting things of people but isn't a friendship supposed to be a 2-way street? 

I feel so crushingly lonely when I think about all this. There's this video from Kurzgesagt about loneliness and in that they say that the feeling of loneliness has the evolutionary purpose of saving you from the threat of being excluded from the tribe. If these were the days when humans lived in tribes I would basically be deemed to not be worthy of survival.

Every friendship that starts has so much at stake for me. I can't face another one-sided thing. It's such a slap in the face, like I'm not worth knowing. Which is why I avoid investing myself in anything nowadays.

These strings of continuous unreciprocated experiences have left me incapable of taking care of myself. Everything I do for myself feels not worth doing. Even talking about myself feels like a waste of time. If I try so hard to be part of the world and it rejects me, why should I care to survive at all?",3

Any time ANYTHING happens to someone I care about, even a little bit, I get such bad anxiety that I am often unable to focus on other things. 

So, as I said, in high school. When I first started high school, life was a mess. What’s important to know is that I had just made a massive transition and had come out of the closet. Not a lot of support from family, but that’s okay.

In my particular HS, we have a home room class, and you have that teacher for home room for all 4 years. When I met my home room teacher, she was incredibly kind. For all 4 years, she continued to be this way. She made cards for everyone birthday, talked to me when I was rejected romantically for the first time, and always listened. We talked to each other while getting ready for the day nearly every day for the last two years. 

This week, she’s been absent. Very strange. Then, on Wednesday, she says in a slide prepared for the sub that she’s out on medical leave for the next few weeks. It wasn’t planned, you could tell from the way she talked in the slides of the previous days. 

I find out that she’s in the hospital, but fine. INSTANTLY, I’m full of anxiety, feeling like my soul was removed from my body. I’m just worried, like, a lot. I KNOW she’s fine, as far as everyone knows. I also led an effort for a “Get Well Soon” card, being given to her by another teacher she’s friends with. I don’t really know how to just patiently wait for the 3-4 weeks until she gets back. 

I’d also like to say that I KNOW she’s fine. My brain does not seem to feel the same way, especially when I’m not actively doing something distracting.

Growing up, I had a difficult childhood. My father and stepfather were both abusive and would often beat me up for the smallest reasons. I remember hiding in my room and praying that they would leave me alone, but it never worked.

My mom was an alcoholic, and she never showed me any love or affection. She was always too drunk to care about anything that was going on in my life. I felt like I was all alone in the world, and I had no one to turn to.

As a result of my childhood, I developed a deep sense of trust issues. I find it hard to open up to people and let them in. I am constantly afraid that they will hurt me in some way, just like my father and stepfather did.

But despite all of this, I refuse to let my past define me. I am determined to make something of myself and create a better life for me. College has been a fresh start for me, and I have made some friends who seem to genuinely care about me.

However, even with my newfound friendships, I still find it hard to trust people. I am always on guard and keep people at arm's length, afraid that they will hurt me like my father and stepfather did.

Sometimes, I wish I could forget about my past and start anew, but it's always there in the back of my mind, haunting me. It's hard to let go of the pain and the memories that shaped me into the person I am today.

So, we had sex last night and afterwards when we were cuddling in bed he kissed me and said “I’m so glad you’re back. I missed you.”

Music was my life, I was part of jazz music programs inside and out of school , wind orchestras, scored perfectly on all my NYSSMA performances ( New York State Music Association) even skipped a few levels because I was advanced. And part of All County band programs(a hand selection of students to be part of a large bad group that would perform in front of 100's of people). I then moved on to get a scholarship to a music college, I however decided to join the army instead and became a profession musician for them for 8 years, performing for presidential speeches, Veterans day and St.Patrick day parades in NYC, played half time shows at NFL games etc. I used to love just sitting at a piano and letting the music flow through me, sure I wasn't the best in the world, but the raw emotion I put into my music was just a feeling I can't even explain, now it's been over 4 years since I've touched sn instrument and I just feel so empty about it.

4801,"Bipolar &amp; Resilience Hey everyone,

I am far from a inspirational speaker but I wanted to just hop on and say that when it comes to my BiPD I feel I am a much stronger person because of it. I grew up with a mom who likely had the disorder as well but took the path to meth as her escape and my dad was always working and never there. 

I grew up on my own and didn't find out I had the disorder till I was in my late teens. I wasn't able to go to college and I struggled to find work that was a fit and take care of myself for a bit but now I am happy to say I found the best job and make more money without a degree than most.

This IS NOT me bragging, I say all of this to show that I think we all forget sometimes that while having this disorder is a struggle it can teach us a lot of lessons. It also allows many of us to think differently and that can be a benefit. The problem is finding a way to get to stability to be able to use it in a way that doesn't make us self-destruct. I know it's hard (understatement of the year), and everyone has to find thier own path because it is definitely not one size fits all. I hope anyone who sees this knows there is hope, it's the small wins that keep it alive. Small ones lead to larger ripples in life.

My mother would tell me I’m exactly the same type of person as the lyrics of this song describe. She called me a sociopath, someone really sick in the head and not redeemable. That I tried to purposely ruin my family’s lives. Like I had a secret agenda that even I couldn’t know about.

I feel like she’s only my friend because she falsely believes I have potential. I feel like I’ve somehow manipulated her into thinking I’m a nice person. I feel like I’m so much worse than she thinks. I can’t understand why someone would care about me, other than they must be confused thinking of the wrong person. I can’t believe the situation I’m in. It happens every single time, and I never learn.

I get her texts saying I need to try to get help and I just want to sink into the ground and die. I feel like I’ve done something really wrong and should stop talking to her. The answer is simple: stop avoiding therapy. Actually tell the therapist the truth. Everyone is sick of me including me.",3

4830,"Inner Sanctuary of Peace Hello - this is a short story that at least for me, it was a great anxiety relief. If you like it, I will post more. 

Once upon a time in a serene village, nestled within a lush green valley, there lived a gentle, wise elephant named Elara. This village was known for its tranquility, as it was graced with a unique energy that seemed to ease the worries and stresses of all who lived there.

One day, a young girl named Mia came to the village, seeking relief from her overwhelming anxiety. Upon hearing about Elara's wisdom, she ventured to the peaceful grove where the elephant resided. The moment Mia approached, she felt her heart rate slowing and her breath deepening.

""Elara, I've heard of your wisdom and calming presence. Please, can you help me with my anxiety?"" Mia asked timidly.

Elara looked at her with gentle eyes and replied, ""Of course, dear child. Sit down beside me, and let me share with you the secret to finding peace within yourself.""

As Mia settled down, Elara began to tell her a story.

""Long ago, our village was visited by a wise old monk. He too had experienced the tranquility of our valley and wished to uncover the source of this peaceful energy. He spent many days meditating under the ancient oak tree at the center of the village. Finally, he discovered the secret: within each of us exists a tiny, peaceful oasis, an inner sanctuary that remains untouched by the chaos of the world.""

The wise elephant continued, ""To access this sanctuary, you must learn to quiet your mind and listen to the rhythm of your own breath. Begin by taking slow, deep breaths, inhaling through your nose and exhaling through your mouth. With each breath, imagine your worries dissolving into the wind, leaving only peace and tranquility behind.""

Mia closed her eyes and followed Elara's guidance. As she inhaled and exhaled, she felt her anxiety ebbing away, replaced with a sense of calm and safety she had never known before.

After some time, Mia opened her eyes and looked at the wise elephant. ""Thank you, Elara. Your words have brought me peace, and I will carry this lesson with me wherever I go.""

As Mia prepared to leave, Elara touched her trunk gently to the girl's shoulder. ""Remember, dear child, your inner sanctuary is always within you. Whenever you feel overwhelmed or anxious, simply close your eyes, breathe deeply, and allow yourself to find refuge in the peaceful oasis of your heart.""

With newfound strength and a heart filled with gratitude, Mia returned to her life, carrying the wisdom of Elara and the tranquility of the village with her. She had discovered the power of her inner sanctuary, and now, she was ready to face the world with courage and serenity.",4

So besides my work life, I have potential academic plans. I love studying, reading, writing. I have so many ambitions with all these things I want to write. I might even publish them. I spend a lot of time-effort on these studies I do on my personal life.

The weird thing is, whenever I go into focused studying, the idea that I will die anyways comes to my mind. I start to feel like this effort is for nothing, that I will die eventually, maybe even soon. I read about these scholars of the past, and see that some of them died so young. What will all this information help me with if I am going to die anyways? Will I have enough time to categorize-interpret-publish so much knowledge?

Anyways, lots of anxious thoughts suddenly rush to my mind about mortality. I had this back in uni as well. I remember when I studied a lot during my masters, I would always start thinking about my mortality and whether all the work I do is even worth it....

Is there a scientific explanation to this? Why would studying in a focused manner put me in such an  existential crisis each time?

4856,"Dealing with this condition. Hello everyone! This is my first time posting in this group. I was diagnosed with bp2 after struggling for years with depression and supposedly mania also. But I was also diagnosed with adhd a little over a month ago. Both felt like I was diagnosed relatively quickly. Idk if that’s a good or bad thing. My depression has always been bad especially in my teens but my best friend died of suicide when I was 18 and it got worse from there. Im currently 21 and have no will or desire to pretty much live( not suicidal I think) life just seems pointless when im always depressed, I have zero motivation to do anything. Im in therapy but it feels like it’s not helping. I was recently put on vyvanse to help with my supposed adhd diagnosis. It’s helped with my motivation a little but hasnt really done much. And every anti depressant/psychotic has either made me worse or done the bare minimum which is keeping me alive. Ive been on 5+ different medications since my bp2 diagnosis 2 years ago. Ive had maybe 2 or 3 hypo manic phases since my diagnosis but their never anything more than a day or 2 of euphoria and more motivation and a splash of poor impulsive decision making. I don’t really know where I’m going with this other than how the fuck do you guys deal with this? My lifes been at a complete stand still since I was around 16-17. I have no diploma, no job and not a single desire to pretty much be a human at this point. Sorry for the long post I just figured I’d give an insight to what life is for me. Any help/advice is much appreciated since I feel so alone and like no one understands.",2
4857,"I moved out. A friend of mine was talking to me about my family situation and I told him about how I wanted to put distance between me and them. He said that he might have some ideas and that we could work something out.

I've been in a new place now for five days. I have a roommate, he is cool. His work keeps me from seeing him very much, so I only have to deal with other people in small doses. 

The best thing is that I'm finally away from my relatives! It always feels weird when I say ""I miss you too"" over the phone because I don't miss them at all. I'm so happy to finally be freed of them!

People do keep telling me that it's natural for me to feel this way and that I'll miss them eventually, but I don't want to miss them. I had to go back earlier today to pick up some of my stuff, but I dreaded seeing anyone there. I left as soon as I could, and I guess I just don't know how to feel now. 

I still love them, I never didn't love my relatives, but I know they're not good for me. I am much better on my own. I guess I just feel guilty, like I owe them something. Part of me wants to go back and try to fix them, but I have to keep reminding myself that I can't do that, and that they're not my responsibility. 

So, I'm determined to not go back for as long as possible. The only reason I'd go back now is to get my bike, but I can be without that for a while. Otherwise, I'm done belonging to them. I am my own person now, and I'm slowly getting to like who I'm becoming.

I definitely still have many times where I hate myself for messing something up or blaming myself for something that can't be helped or just wasn't my fault. But overall, things are getting better, and me leaving my relatives behind is just one of many steps in the right direction.",3

I've just sent off an email for a volunteering work, it's a simple museum carer, I will take care of the gardens, the tourists and whatever needs available.
I needed to do this, to boost up my CV because I can't work (because sadly..AVPD and CPTSD)

It's all flexible hours, I won't get into any trouble if I miss a few days or whatnot.

But I am still. So. Fucking. Scared.

This isn't anything, ""O new situation fear"" no I've been to the museum once or twice and know the people, I know the community. 

But I am so damn fucking scared of rejection. I am scared of the possible outcomes this will bring me. I am scared of the social aspects of it.
I keep getting these thoughts of, ""they'll think I'm a creep"" ""I'll probably never keep up with it because I am a pathetic good for nothing, lower to everyone else"".
It's hurting me. 

And I need advice on how to just keep going, what should I do once it starts? Fight through the thoughts and fears?

It was already hard enough as it was to do the paper, now I'm crashing wondering ""What the fuck was I thinking!?"" 

But I'm trying to keep positive as much as I possibly can. This could be a mix of social anxiety and AVPD running it's course but I don't know, all I know is that I am scared and very fearful of the future, of people, of being seeing in public, of messing up big time.

Any words of encouragement or advice will help a lot. Thank you.",3

My triggers Ive found are repeating myself, getting ignored completely, ""have time for a quick call?"", and having to do other people's jobs for them. Now this all being said, none of that should have been happening anyway because all that is supposed to go to my TOM, not me.

They're letting me back in little by little to avoid another nervous breakdown next week, but I'm already feeling the stress.

I usually took this for granted all the time but yesterday after dropping her at her home tears started coming out of my eyes because of how much I hated this. I actually don't have anyone to talk about this with neither can I go to a therapist or whatever, can anyone please please please help me a little bit. 
I will appreciate it a lot.

If someone can understand that I feel alone since I was little. I have always sought to be seen, appreciated, respected.
My parents divorced when I was 5 years old. Since then, the relationship with my father has not been, because he is the most lying person I know. All my life he just promised me things and never kept his word. Now he has his family, which he does not take care of. Her children live with him, but they actually live like I did. My mother was always away in another country. He tried to compensate for the fact that all his life he ran after the perfect man and thus he neglected me. He never chose me. To want to move together to do something new 2. She chose men who, I'm sorry, did to her. And I had to grow up with my grandparents. With my grandfather always beating my grandmother. I saw all kinds of arguments, fights, scandals and everything that a child should not see. I always grew up with words like ""you're not good for anything, you don't know how to do anything, you're like my mom, you're like tactu"" My mother has 2 brothers, who are super narcissists. That they gave me a juice when I was younger ""they raised me"". Grandma raised the men of the family as if everything was theirs. And my mother and I always had to do everything. From food, cleaning, money... Everything. No, they are men and we are women. Ever since I was little, I used to fight with everyone, because I was always different. I don't consider that my purpose is to find a man, to have a child and that's...as my family wants. I always wanted more. Because of this, my jobs were not exactly easy either. I was a team leader at 19, and it still wasn't enough, although no one in the family did more than me...
My grandfather died 2 years ago, and since then the family fell apart even more. My mother left again to another country, after her boyfriend who is my age and treats her worse than anything.. and I stay at home with my grandmother, who is also mean.
I tried everything, to meditate, to go to a psychologist, to stop thinking about all the things. Anything...
I feel alone, abandoned. As everyone sees their life, I remain here behind, worthless, with nothing. I have nothing. Not a day goes by that I don't think I want to die... Thank you.",1

4890,"Boyfriend broke up with me over my AvPD I was already thinking about breaking up with him just because AvPD made it too painful and scary to be in a relationship even when he didn’t necessarily do anything wrong, but it’s still gut-wrenching. I’m not necessarily heartbroken, I just feel like shit because his reasoning boiled down to “I get you have AvPD and you can’t help it, but it’s your fault this isn’t working out”. He was sick of me constantly ghosting him, never directly communicating or confronting him about anything, and he called me childish for being unable to have a difficult conversation like an adult.

I already feel guilty enough about the way AvPD makes me act without someone I thought was understanding telling me exactly all the ways I ruined this for him, all of which just so happen to be things I already constantly worry are reasons people avoid or despise me. In situations like this, people usually say some shit like “it’s not you it’s me” or go easy on you, right?

Not to mention, one of his reasons was that I was ghosting him while I have been in animation crunch on a tight deadline so I genuinely didn’t have the time or energy to even read messages whatsoever let alone respond, which feels like maybe he should’ve been a tiny bit more understanding of, but in terms of the big picture, I guess I understand. 

It still feels like shit though. I’ve never been broken up with before, and even though I wanted out since the week he first confessed to me, I don’t know if I’ll be able to get over this that easy just because he wanted me to know I was the bad boyfriend and everything I was insecure about, I have every right to hate myself for.

I’m not used to having good things happen to me and my life is finally starting to improve so I’m just constantly on edge. My past four dreams havent been good, in one my friends started being rude to me, in another my food messed up, I wasn’t able to eat, my family was rude and my period started (haha my period then started 30 minutes after waking up), and these past two other days were focused on appendicitis in one I got it, had bad pain and then woke up freaking out (only had back pain tho which passed), and in the other I had it and got surgery. That dream did help me start to slowly get over my fear of it though. But I feel like if I stop worrying then it’ll happen, i know when I finally get distracted I start to think “huh maybe I’ll be okay, i don’t feel like anything bad would happen” and then sudden fear and feeling of it going to happen. Fucking lord go away. I just need to be okay for 13 more days and then I can see my therapist but my mind doesnt think ill make it in these 13 days.

4899,"Nervous about my final exam for this class I’m a non-traditional college student who went back to community college in 2020. I started off taking algebra 2, then precalculus, then trigonometry, and now I’m in Differential Calculus. I’ve gotten straight A’s in all my completed math courses as well as A’s in non-math courses (1 B in an English class) and I really need to maintain my GPA since I really want to get into a top BSN program in my country. That program requires taking a lot of prerequisites that are STEM heavy (organic chemistry, calculus). The reason why I want to make this my goal is because growing up, I’ve always been told I was mediocre and dumb by people in my family as well as outsiders. I also see my parents getting older each day and it pains me in my heart to realize that I’m consider a failure in their eyes. So far I have a 97.78% in my Calc class but finals is in 12 days and I know nothing about the last chapter of my calculus class (this current professor does not teach at all compared to my past math professors) so I always just end up watching YouTube videos and asking redditors on the math subreddit. The thing is I’m feeling extreme procrastination at this point and I just want this class to be over because the professor is so terrible. My issue is that I want to maintain an A but since my finals is literally 30% of my grade I am scared that I won’t have an A anymore if I bomb it. Are there any tips y’all can give me to not stress so much and to stop procrastination?",0

I don't really care what label is put on me for myself but my new mental health team is going to get this letter and prescribe medication/therapy accordingly. As I do really struggle with anxiety I'd like to get help for it but this seems like it's not a legitimate things and just a passing comment.

If it helps they removed eupd from the original psychiatrist and added ""anxiety"" is it just people don't like diagnosing bpd so used this as a substitute? I live in care so although I don't like having the label bpd it does give my support workers different expectations (emotional disregulatuion, abandonment issues, destructive behaviour).

After the war he tried to contact her to be with him, but she wanted nothing more to do with him, so he started a new life, family, got married . He had this one picture ofher(in her auschwitz prisoner uniform) , and he used to cut out her head and put her on another clothing, away from Auschwitz. He used to do this for the most of his life (the filmaker says it was a way for him to imagine an alternative life they could have had).He copied the picture and kept it in his wallet until the day he died. So when his daughter was 16 she said her father told her about this Jewish girl, and that he never ever in his life felt true love like that. He even gave his daughter a locket with a picture of him and his ex Jewish girlfriend, not her mother. His daughter said it was odd, and she also said that this Jewish girl was the love of his life(in a documentary, there was a documentary made about them). So the filmmaker which is close to both his and Jewish girls families said that the ss officer was deeply and truly in love in this Jewish girl, till the day he died. His wife also knew about his ex.So in 1972 he had to go to the court because of his war crimes against humanity, and his ex Jewish girlfriend was a witness,when he saw her after 30 years of no contact he started to cry. Does that mean even while married to his wife he loved his ex girlfriend more? Does that mean that he would maybe leave his wife for her?",0

4922,"psychiatrist told me not to google my medication, feeling weird about it starting this off by establishing that I am autistic, and one of my interests is self categorization. this can make me come across as a hypochondriac or doctor shopper, as I know my disorders/illnesses very well. once I started seeking treatment for my bipolar I learned everything there was to learn, joined communities such as this one, and started talking to others with bipolar.

as a result of this, I learned a lot about medication. not even really on purpose, learning about the meds people are on is just an inevitable of being in a group like this.

my psyche prescribed me abilify today, and out of curiosity I asked if that was the med known to sometimes lead to tardive dyskinesia. I'm not against trying abilify, all meds can have horrible side effects, but I wanted to know if that's what I was potentially getting myself into. I love my psyche, she's super nice and receptive, but she sorta laughed and told me to ""stop googling your medication"" which rubbed me the wrong way. it's a drug I'm unfamiliar with, should I not want to be prepared for the potential risks? I've told her before I'm open to trying anything, so it's not like I was telling her I wouldn't take it because I was scared, I was just asking a question so I know what to look out for.

There's nothing really to talk to others about because again, there's nothing that I'd even remotely describe as saddening or upsetting.

It’s gotten so bad that I barely leave the house and I’m afraid to exert myself which is depressing because I used to be a gym rat and exercising was what I used to do help cope with my anxiety but that’s not something I can do anymore, Atleast In my mind I can’t. This has really intensified over this past year after dealing with multiple panic attacks that have landed me in the ER and I’ve been getting  a bunch of physical symptoms constantly that does not help with my worrying. I’ve had many tests done and the doctors are very reassured that I’m healthy. My Doc believes the Lexapro will help me but I can’t seem to find the courage to take it. I’m just so terrified of it, I’d really appreciate some encouragement to start my meds because I high key hate living like this .😭",4
4967,"My friend expressed that she is disappointed in me. Long story short, I felt tired and anxious and wanted to go home and skip one class. I didn't show up for this class in forever and didn't turn in much work, so she was worried I'd procrastinate like I did in 1 semester and fail.

When I said I'll probably skip again, she looked at me with so much disappointment, and said ""I really should stop caring about people that much"".

It didn't register then, but it hits me now how hurt I am from her words. It feels like I'm not doing good enough, and I probably am not. So that day I forced myself to sit through the class and even showed some progress to my professor. But I can't get the look on her face out of my mind.

To be fair to her, I said I needed to leave in a kinda joking manner because that's my coping mechanism. So maybe she didn't think I felt as horrible as I did and thought i wanted to skip to avoid work.",3

4972,"I'm literally too awkward for therapy I'm doing CBT and my therapist always asks me what I'm thinking and all I can say is ""I don't know"" because my mind always goes blank. I can't articulate my emotions either and don't even know what I want in life.

Today we did an exercise where I was supposed to have a ""conversation"" between my ""critical voice"" and my ""confident voice"". I told her I'm extremely uncomfortable doing it and she said it's fine we don't have to but I wanted to try it anyways. I could think of hundreds of things I hate about myself but not a single thing I liked about myself. It was so awkward sitting there and not saying a positive thing. My therapist even asked me if I'm having any suicidal thoughts afterwards, that's how bad I must have looked. When I looked in her eyes she seemed clueless, like she's never seen anyone that bad and has no idea how to help me.

I don't believe my problems are something I can fix by just changing the way I think about myself. I am not an interesting person. I'm not an attractive person. I just feel like there's nothing of value about me and people find me repulsive.",3

I didn’t have my own room before I left to college. I had to lose one of the unused rooms in my house as my personal room, unfortunately, my parents decided that they prefer this room compared to the master bedroom. It was fine at the moment because I was away at college and I had a house near my school. Now that I’m about to graduate and hopefully move back home to save money I have brought up this issue if I could get the room back but instead of hearing me out, they had stated that I can just go to the library study. I am not sure whether or not I should just suck it up and move back home or save up enough money to move out officially. Any advice would be wonderful!",0

4975,"what to say to those who you ghosted and what they might say I know some people are happy to cut ties with people, but others feel guilty or anxious about cutting ties and freeze because too much time has passed. If someone reached out to me and said something along the lines of struggling with personal things, that would be so helpful even if much time has passed. The people who you have ghosted are probably hurt and confused, and the truth is they probably internalized it as something THEY have said or done wrong. If they did not do anything wrong, that is something to highlight.

""Hi. I just wanted you to know that I have been struggling with some personal things, and that's why I haven't reached out. I am still struggling and not ready to maintain friendships just yet. But I do want to let you know I care. I'm sorry if I have left you hurt and confused. It was not something you have done wrong."" I am not in a place to explain further, but I do hope you are well.""

Some people may be understanding, and some people may still be reeling from the hurt and not respond at all, or they may decide that they do not want to open the door back up to having contact with you now or in the future because they felt that they were rejected and don't want to risk that again. Rejection hurts people without mental illness, too! That is not necessarily a rejection of you, but more of a reflection of the place where they're at mentally. It may have taken them a while to move on from the relationship/friendship. Some people may feel that keeping that door closed is protecting them from getting hurt again. In my opinion, that is more than a fair response so before you do reach out if you decide to, you have to mentally prepare for whatever decision someone will make. One way to look at it is you get the chance to prepare for their response when they never got a chance to prepare for being ghosted (unless you let them know you ghost at times).",3

I'd go to work, one of the parents would tell me what I needed to know and then went to work. When they got back in the evening we'd say ""goodnight"" and that was it. 

Since covid, however, at least one of the parents works from home. I currently work for a family with BOTH parents work from home. It's terrible. I jump at every noise that might mean they are coming to ""say hi"" to their kid. I worry so much about where they are, what they think they're hearing when I talk to their baby, my appearance, the way I dress. I imagine they're mocking the way I sneeze or they're disgusted by my weight gain.

I grew up in a family very withholding of affection, it was very conditional; so i think I learned to reverse that, in a weird “power-play” in a way.

circling back to the roasting, they will so easily bring up this trauma as a “roast” and something to laugh at, invalidate my mental illness, and make fun of me for attending therapy because i’m “wasting money for someone to tell me i’m normal”. i fucking hate that i can’t seem to let go of their friendship despite how awful i feel about all of them, but i feel like without them i don’t have anyone to do things with or talk to all the time. idk what to do. it’s either be alone and have them in case or just be alone period and obviously that will just continue this cycle of loneliness and dark depression. wtf do i do. ☹️",1

* Spice and wolf

* Girl's last tour

* Serial Experiments Lain

They are not really related in any genre way but all feature some sort of disconnect with the MCs and the rest of the world. It's like you're just traveling through it and never really putting down roots but instead just observing for a while and then moving on, they all sort of have this somber undertone that you're not really a part of the world and just experiencing small parts of it. 

Most of them feature a pair traveling together which makes it feel less lonely but Mushishi only has the MC and that's the one that feels closest to AvPD in a weird way in my mind.

5012,"Horrible Fear of Food Being Drugged Lately I’ve been having this massively irrational fear of my food being laced with LSD or some other form of psychedelics.  I won’t eat something that’s been already opened regardless of whether or not it’s mine, which has led to me not only wasting food, but actively avoiding eating unless I make it right there, and even then it takes quite a bit of effort.  This in turn has also led me to having a fear of an undiagnosed mental illness, and I can’t quite afford to go to a doctor currently to figure out if that is the case.

I’ve only ever been technically “drugged” once when the cannabis my friend bought was laced with PCP a few months ago but this fear extends back to when I was around fifteen (twenty three now).  I’ve done acid only twice and while I did enjoy it, it’s not something I’m likely to do again, and I rarely smoke cannabis or drink, but I did do a lot of both for a few years.

  Obviously nobody is gonna waste good acid on me but the fear is constantly there to the point that I yelled at my brother the other day for jokingly pretending to drop something into my Gatorade on the way to work (he’s unaware of this fear) and threw it away despite it being completely full, and even avoided eating the cookies my mom brought down for Christmas, which made me feel awful as there is absolutely no way my mom would ever do anything like that to me.

I’m iffy on telling anybody close to me about this fear for a few reasons, the main one being the irrationality of it all, but I also do not want to be sent to an inpatient center (again, can’t afford it) as I was for depression as a minor.

5020,Why is AVPD considered a personality disorder and not a mental illness? So from what i have read seems like AVPD is the only pure ego-dystonic personality disorder and usually personality disorders are seen as a flaw in someone's personality and are ego-syntonic in nature but in the case of AVPD seems like no one likes to have this condition. So why isn't AVPD considered a mental illness because the symptoms of someone with AVPD seems to match up with different things like social anxiety and extreme low self esteem?

I’ve been living alone for all my adult years and I work from home. I don’t have any kind of social life and can easily spend several weeks without seeing or speaking to anyone. I do have family, but they all live far away and I don’t see them often.

So sometimes I can’t help but wonder what would happen if I ever have a stroke or a heart attack, or if I fall down the stairs, or if I choke on some food… I often read about people being found dead in their home several years or even decades after they died, and deep down I’m convinced that’s how I’ll end up.

5026,"Is the stress of my international sales job worth the benefits? Looking for guidance….. Hi,

I’m a sales director who recently received a promotion to build and lead a new sales operation for an Australian media company in a foreign country. After relocating my family and settling into our new home, I found the job to be manageable, albeit stressful, for the first 8-9 months.

However, after a year, I've realized that the stress has become a part of my daily routine, and it's starting to change my personality. I'm experiencing burnout, feeling completely drained, unmotivated, and even depressed at times. I report to upper management located overseas who may not fully understand the realities of building a new operation in a foreign country. Despite being expected to do more with less, the results are still expected.

I'm struggling to decide if I should push through this or throw in the towel. On one hand, the benefits of international experience, such as building and managing a team in a new market and exploring new commercial initiatives, are invaluable. On the other hand, the stress is taking its toll, and I'm not sure if it's worth it.

I would appreciate any advice from those who have been in similar situations or know someone who has. It can be quite isolating, and I lack a trusted network of experienced expats to turn to for guidance. Thank you in advance for your help.",0
5027,"Update to 'Oh god, I have a date' [My old post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AvPD/comments/zwc806/oh_god_i_have_a_date/)

Hi everyone!

Since you all were so kind I wanted to share my experience. The date went okay, but she kind of felt distant to me afterwards, shorter answers, not really engaging in text chats.  
It felt like she had no interest so I stopped texting her.  
Last Wednesday after a dance class some people went to a bar in the same building. I chatted with her and some other people. It was quite nice.  
Afterwards we had the same way home so we walked together and kept talking.  
She talked about some mental health problems she had and how she was dealing with it, therapy and so on. She was quite open and frank.  
Later when I was at home I thought about how she was in person compared to the text messages. My picture of her had changed a bit. Previously I would have said she was quite the confident woman (I still think she is though), but afterwards I saw that she also had internal struggles and insecurities.  
So, I today decided to ask her again if she'd like to meet for a coffee.  
She texted me back, that she thinks I'm really sweet and it's always fun talking with me, but her life is too ""full"" right now and she has no place right now for another friendship or something deeper. She'd like to keep it at the dance lessons and socials. She is sorry, that's probably not the answer I was hoping for, but she is just trying to being honest.  
I wrote back, that it wasn't the answer I hoped for, but I thought I would get. I thought she was a great person and find her to be pretty awesome, so I had to write her.  
  
So, that's it. I'm a bit sad now, although I knew this would be  coming. Still it's better to be in the clear.  
  
I've given up some hope to find a partner. It's so hard not to be frustrated or be frustrated, live through the frustration and get out of it on top.  
  
My few relationships began during those very rare moments in my life, where I was truly happy. A condition that feels unreachable at the moment. This makes it feel impossible to find love.  
I try to be the best person I can be, but it never feels enough.",3

However I've never experienced symptoms this extreme before.  Usually I just get tension in my neck from stress.

After a process of elimination I am now starting to consider it may be stress.  I'm not myself lately.  The frustrating part is these symptoms have been going on 3 weeks now and I can't figure it out.

My biggest symptom is **Extreme Fatigue** both physical and mental despite sleeping more.  I can't clench my fists as hard as usual to give you a scale.  I sleep more than normal lately and wake up very tired.

**Easily startled**.  I guess this means for some reason my guard is up.

**I'm very hungry**\-The sensation to eat is still there despite after eating a meal and my stomach being full.

**Disorientation**\- This one is hard to explain.  In groups of people I get confused if they are looking at me or the person next to me.  When I went out dancing and spinned I had a hard time not stumbling.

\*\*Mental Fog-\*\*I'm ""Spacey""

\*\*Irritable-\*\*I just feel like I've got bad vibes right now.  In situations I should be good spirited and I irritated easy.  A little inconvenience will feel like a huge problem.

**Headaches**\-I usually wake up with a headache.

**Low motivation-** I love to workout but I've been skipping days.  Very uncharacteristic of me.  Days I do go I force myself.   I'll procrastinate small easy projects.

**Weakness.**

**Dreaming more.**

It bothers me that I’m failing out, but not *nearly* as much as the fear of how my abusive family will react to having to bail me out of trouble *again*.

5089,"Moved away to be married, why can't I be happy? I'm supposed to be happy Trigger warnings btw

Hi, idk if this is in the right place but I just need to get stuff out.
I (24f) should be so happy an excited, I'm getting married next week. I love my Fiance, and I want to marry him. 
But I've had to move hundreds of miles away from my mum and my friends. 
I have BPD and probably autism, but NHS won't help me get diagnosis for either.

I haven't been working and been living with my parents becase of depression. Now because me and husband can barely afford a basic place to live I will have to work. And I want to. I want to be so capable and successful and hard working but I just want to kms anytime I think of getting up and going out.

I've only been living in my new town a week, and everytime i remember im not going home i feel so depressed. 

All my Fiance can say is he's sorry. But that doesn't fix anything or help me or comfort me at all, and my BPD shuts any suggestions he has down because substitues wont help. I don't know anyone here,   and everyone in my community is old. And whilst yes old people can make lovely friends, It's not the same.

I can't drive, afford to drive or have the mental stability to drive so I feel so lonely and depressed.

i spent the night drinking heavily, chatting with random men (nsfw stuff) online to make me hate myself even more than i already do (i’m a lesbian, wtf???), crying hysterically for no reason, slept for one whole hour, woke up still drunk and then ended my career a few hours later when i got sober because i was 1000% convinced i was going to be fired for no reason. literally what the fuck. 

this was yesterday. i’m absolutely not coping, it hasn’t even really hit me and i’m really scared for when it does. the only reason i haven’t hurt myself as punishment is i don’t feel like i deserve even that relief.

I think I have social anxiety (no official diagnosis because getting any kind of official diagnosis is difficult here but it's fairly obvious and several mental health professionals I've seen acknowledged it) but I recognise myself a lot in the symptoms of AvPD. I tried looking online what the exact difference between social anxiety and AvPD but I didn't really find anything useful or well explained enough.

Is there any good ressources (books, YouTube channel, website,...) on this topic that you would recommend. Is it okay for me self diagnose?",3
5115,"My brain just goes blank even if I want to engage I don't know if this is an AvPD thing or not, but does anybody else here mostly don't speak as much during conversations because your brain just goes completely blank? I frequently find myself at conversations (most of them tbh) where I **want** to talk and engage but I just don't know what to respond at all. I catch myself saying a lot of ""mmm"", ""yeah"", ""it's true"", ""I agree"" but not something... substancial, you know? Sometimes I even repeat words just to use more time like ""yeah, yeah"".

Meanwhile, when I observe the way other people talk is like they always have something to say, some comment to make or something to keep the conversation going, and it seems so natural for them. I always get afraid that people will like other people more because they can offer more during a conversation than I can, and honestly I think this has been proven true over time.

Some time ago I created a personal ""system"" to help me ""fill up silences"" and some of the things I set myself to do at these moments where: **1. just think out loud without filtering so much** (I read somewhere that one of the differences between extroverts and introverts is that the first ones sometimes ""think with their mouths"" while introverts think first, then decide if it's worth sharing - and for us with AvPD and/or SAD we mostly decide it is not -) and **2. look for a subject connection, even if it's minimal, then be like ""this reminds me of..."" and keep going about it**.

When I observe other people interacting I can see them using these a lot (naturally; I feel like a robot because I had to sit down and actually think to came up with these and have to make an effort to put them in practice) but even with this system, I'm still having problems because, like I said, a lot of times I simply can't think of anything.

5121,"Can’t even resign myself to the fact that this is my life… I often feel if I could accept my depression that I wouldn’t struggle as much as I do. I wonder if the fight and the hope, however dim that light might be, are the reasons why I can’t seem to shake the bone crushing sadness. It’s so PHYSICALLY uncomfortable now.

I haven’t handled becoming a full time caregiver to my very sick wife well. I haven’t grieved having to walk away from the work I love to do so. I haven’t managed to find any peace with the idea that I might never know physical or sexual intimacy ever again. 

My depression, anxiety, agoraphobia all pre-date these turns of events, but the way they’ve been amplified and my inability to effectively cope has caused me a shit ton of distress. I find that I tend to isolate even more than usual because I genuinely can’t imagine anyone wants to spend time or energy on someone with such a low self esteem. I have tried to take steps towards combatting the loneliness, but every time I get close to breaking the cycle I’ve created for myself, I run away and hide. I do wonder if this is because I know I can’t handle another heartbreak or rejection and so I’ve subconsciously determined the risks are too high, that connection with anyone else could push me over what it already a precarious cliff.

I just want safe connection. Someone who knows what and who I am going in and accepts the subsequent ups and downs while remaining as committed to my well being as I would be to theirs.

I come here and post sometimes, but nothing much comes of it. I guess I hope that one day the right person will see my post at the right time and the universe will connect two lost souls so we can help each other navigate out of the hell that is depression.

Is that you? Please feel free to send me a message. If you have the same fears that I do, I promise you that I will work to ensure we have a safe space to talk, to figure out, to grow…I dunno…is this all wishful thinking? I guess I want something more tangible to cling to…",1

5142,"Overthinking and feeling powerless in social situations Social situations are nerve wracking because they are unpredictable and I have to come up with responses on the spot. There is also the pressure of the other party potentially manipulating you such as in business situations, or when someone is trying to sell something to you.

So before these situations I often try to play out all the different paths that the interaction could take place and try to prepare everything for it. This makes each social interaction extremely high effort for little reward in comparison.

There are also worst possible outcomes in which there is no way to prepare for and where there is nothing you can do about it. For example, suppose I was buying something from a shop, I hand over my money, and then the shop keeper just ignores me, what can I actually do in that situation? Call the cops? Get a lawyer? What proof do I have that the money was mine and I handed it over? What obliges the shop keeper to give me the item I wanted? 

Normal people never question these dynamics and just put trust in the systems set in place, they've never been burned by it so it just works for them. But here I am worrying over every little thing that I'd rather hide away from it all if possible.",3

I had been starting to think that maybe I had even been misdiagnosed back then, but that seems common on this sub...idk, I don't have my parents, or friends, or really any support network... I also can't afford therapy, so i just needed to vent about how scared I feel :( I was certain it was a heart attack.",2

5182,"What is this, what is it You can’t help me. You can, but you can’t. You could care, so you can help me. But you won’t, so you can’t. 

I see that now. I was hoping someone would not come and fix everything for me but that they would care. I tried it all, I tried caring so that maybe someone would too. I tried not to expect anything back and I did that but when things got rough and I cried for help, no one was there. People would only take from me, and now that I’m kind of empty, with nothing left to give, no one’s there.

But only kind of. It’s not so bad that I can’t see a light at the end or that I’ll never smile again. It’s that I’ll probably never get the only thing I ever craved for. That’s terrible actually but I don’t know, shit has a way of always getting worse than it is.

While that undoubtedly sucks, life is about more than that for me. I’m not down 24/7, thank the Lord, so I can’t act like my life is over. Get me not wrong, sometimes it stings really awfully and for long periods too. But there’s an entire world out there beyond my own personal lil one that is fascinating, to use one word to describe life.

I should go back in my head. It was always great every time, I would be my own patter in the back and it worked, it works, because I never let myself down in the sense that I always care.

And it’s not like I want to be babied around either. May not seem like it but I’m a strong person inside, I don’t go down easy and every time I do I never stay there longer than necessary. But even the strongest need a helping hand every now and then and I’ve never had that, not genuinely.

Now is one of those times. And what I needed now isn’t even that big a deal. Just someone who would listen and understand. You’d think that wouldn’t be so hard to find.

Anyway. C’est la vie, cheries. I want to go back and fix myself by myself like I’ve always done but not come back this time. It was only when I came back and hoped that I got bit in the ass. Every single time. But no longer.

I’m smart enough to understand and to move on and to focus elsewhere and to do so many other things this world has to offer that fulfill me. One of the best lessons I learned in life was how to take the L. Accept it, let it go and carry on.

Sometimes when i take vitamins my brain thinks that is enough to keep off my hunger while i sleep. 

A few months ago i completely lost my appetite and didn't eat for over a day. It went away and my appetite came back, but recently I've been eating only one or two meals a day. Not because i want to lose weight. I just am so tired. 

If it's not fast food i can barely eat it. I can't eat a lot anymore. Sometimes the smell of food is sickening even if I'm hungry. Most of my meals are fast food.

5195,"An absence of social pleasure (social anhedonia) It is not possible to know what it is like to experience the world from inside someone else’s body, but I can infer from others that people enjoy being with other people more than I do. 

It is rare that I enjoy a person’s company. Usually I look forward to being alone again. Instead of pleasure, I do feel an absence of loneliness or fear, but these are not pleasure. I very much experience health benefits from being with other people, I can’t deny this, but in the moment I feel like something important is missing. 

To say it different, I don’t feel a desire to be with others unless I am wanting to soothe or avoid loneliness or fear. By default, being alone is peaceful and ideal. 


Is it really anhedonia, or is it also possible that my default is actually that the social anxiety overpowers the social pleasure so that I can’t feel feel. And it takes a really strong negative emotion to overpower social anxiety in order to provoke a desire to be with others.

5232,"""Levels/degress"" of AvPD Recently, i was watching a live of Personality Disorders, and this psychiatry said that there is a reason of why AvPD isn't diagnosed enough or ""clinically useless"" (i didn't like this term): sometimes the AvPD is ""mild"" so it's confused with a normal anxiety, or when more serious it's diagnosed as Social Anxiety.
 The aforementioned speech makes me real pessimistic about this disorder, as iit makes clear that we are really neglected. ""Clinically useless"", what the hell?
 I think that there's a reason for so much misinformation about AvPD: the people who know the most about this disorder are those who suffer daily on skin, but we can't provide clinical care because we are weakened, so there's a big cycle of misinformation and no progress. In short, average people cannot understand us satisfactorily. :(
 Advances on this disorder will certainly come, but I believe it will not be so soon.
 I hope you guys may have understood my point. Discussions are open. :)",3

Working 65 hour weeks, hypersexual behavior, obsessive behavior, delusions and stuff. I was diagnosed 3 years ago, and definitely have been experiencing this since maybe 10 -12 years ago 

Now I actually understand the extreme paranoia, delusions, and minor psychosis and extreme hypersexual behavior

I’ve been having really bad anxiety these past 2-3 months. My dad passed away in December and I had to put my dog down a week ago so I definitely think this has affected my greatly. I’ve never felt this “bad” for this long. Been waking up most days shakey and nervous. Most days I’m worrying about my health and can’t seem to shake off intrusive thoughts. I went to the Doctor on Thursday and was told my blood pressure was high, which made me more anxious. Was precribed some for blood pressure and sertraline for the anxiety. Today I’ve been feeling dizzy, it comes and goes and just loosing interest in normal things. Just a general feeling of feeling off or not all here. Also can’t seem to swallow very well. 

I’m starting to exercise more and eating healthier. I’m hoping to see if anyone has any words of encouragement or has had a similar experience as mine. Also, anyone taking sertraline has any side effects? Anything would help rn. Thank you!

Edit: Side note last night I took a chocolate piece which had cbd and a strand of THC to help me sleep. It made me feel slow and like I wasn’t fully there and gave me really bad dry mouth feeling. Idk if maybe I’m still feeling those symptoms, because still feel out of it and my throat feels like I have something stuck there.",4

Our lives are in turmoil due to many factors but lately my husband’s concussion and brain injury issues have completely put a stretch on our stress limits. I’m not sure where to go or what to do. He’s very upset over his situation and feels like I don’t understand which of course I do not understand it completely but I have a different set of stressors related to this situation. The problem is that our lives had a lot of stress prior to his injury so it’s just too much. I try not to let on how stressed I am because he obviously is in a worse state that me. He won’t talk about things much and when I try to help him he says I’m making it worse and smothering him. He feels that because I have a background working with people with developmental issues I should just know what to do for him but it is way different when it’s your husband versus a client.

5249,"The urge to disappear and start over.  

First I want to say that I am not diagnosed. I've seen quite a lot of posts about this urge to disappear on [r/Schizoid](https://www.reddit.com/r/Schizoid/) and also [r/AvPD](https://www.reddit.com/r/AvPD/).

I am kind of glad that I am not the only one who does this. I constantly delete my social media and start over. By doing this I also ghost all of my friends on Discord. With social media like Reddit, Twitch and others creating new accounts isn't a problem for me because I don't post anything. I only keep my Steam account. I always knew it's not normal. I didn't know other people also struggle with this.

My friends are annoyed whenever I come up with a new Discord account. I really don't want to talk to them about this. It's hard for me to talk about my feelings with people I know. I feel like they wouldn't understand me and/or would judge me. Most of my friends I've known since 2017. I usually just come up with a dumb excuse like ""I forgot my password"" or something like that.

I want to explain the weird urge I get whenever I feel like disappearing. Under a post there was this comment:

&gt;There was a point where I realized I was getting very good at starting things because after a certain point I would get that urge to restart. Not just with accounts, but with everything. I'd plan out how I was going to use an account, build a new habit, accomplish some goal as efficiently and optimally as possible, and for a while follow through. Eventually I would drift off track a little, let it eat at me, and then give up and decide I'll start over and do it better. At this point I struggle to get to the ""I'm going to try"" stage and usually just don't bother. The apathy does help me push through failure or perceived shortcomings a little more.

This comment describes my situation very accurately. I feel almost exactly as this guy.

Creating new accounts has become a routine. I feel like it even calms me and is the closest thing to running away from everything. It's kind of hard to explain how I feel..

I ghosted my friends like 3 weeks ago. Throughout the weeks I've tried to start over, but I always fail and just start over once again.. I didn't tell anyone I'll disappear. I deleted my Discord and now I'm gone. My friend texted me on Snapchat asking why I deleted my account. I just responded with something like ""yeah lol"". Didn't even give an answer. Ever since then I haven't talked to them. I want to, but I know I'm gonna disappear after a month. I also don't want to explain to them why I deleted my account because I can't even do it right now where I am anonymous.

Probably a lot of mistakes, very unorganized post but yeah.. I hate this. I just want to be normal. :/",3

I’ll allow myself to fail, stutter or mumble when I don’t feel comfortable talking in groups, but I’ll talk nonetheless when I have something to say so that I can practice that which I’m not good at.

Which means I’ll allow myself to feel discomfort. Deep discomfort and shame, which I know, will lessen one day or I’ll get used to the feelings. 

I’ll allow myself to be intimate with people I feel comfortable with. And to warn them when I feel like fleeing and hiding. The right people will understand and won’t give up so easily. 

I’ll accept failure, expect disappointment and revel in misery because I know it will lead me to something better than this dark void I’ve been living in the last years of my life.

5305,"I was wondering if you also find it impossible to make difficult decisions? I've been pondering the question of ""what's next"" for almost 2 years now, and I can't make the decision. The country where I now live was always a temporary destination but due to covid I was forced to stay longer than expected. Now I feel like I'm stuck here. It's been 4 years here, 2 years longer than anticipated, and I don't know what to do. Whatever choice I make, it's a big life choice that due to my financial situation locks me in to that choice for a few years. Simply said I don't trust my decisions. When I finally pin something down I ask myself ""is this decision made by a sane mind or am I in some state of either mania or depression"". But because it's so difficult to figure out I end up doing nothing. This has been going on for 2 years now and I'm not sure what to do. Do you have any experience with this, and how do you make big decisions? Is there a way to minimise the risks of a bad decision because of the disease?",2

5307,"Stress Controls My Life! Hey Guys! 

I'm a twenty-one year old student that is currently drowning in the stress that is coming from my college course and my new part-time job. 

My job is causing me an unreal amount of anxiety, to the point where I have to hide in the basement sometimes so I can calm down. I work for a second hand shop for games, DVDs, consoles, and devices like phones and laptops, I started working here about a month ago and from my first day I realised that I was really going to struggle here. 

It's a team of about 25 people and nearly all of them are moody pricks that haven't even introduced themselves to me yet! When I ask them a question they give me a look as if I've just murdered their pets. I try to be nice, and I try to keep a positive outlook, but these people are majorly draining my energy and fuelling my anxiety. The customers are even worse! I've been called homophobic slurs, had games and DVDs tossed at my head and have had my life threatened by these people. 

I haven't been trained properly either. I got thrown on the tills with about two minutes explanation of how they work! My till has been down in cash about four times, due to my crappy training and yet somehow this is my fault - maybe it is, but I'm putting this down to crappy training. 

I can't afford to leave this job, I seriously can't. But I also can't stand being there any more. The job market in Scotland is awful at the moment and virtually no companies hiring right now. 

Please, give me some advice before I start screaming every time I think about my work.",0

I feel so far behind in life now, I didn’t care about my studies back then, or my social life, or my finances, or my skillset or even experiences. I just let things pile up and I now burn out easily because of it. I enrolled back into college but can’t power through it. 

I’m currently just rotting in bed all day, hoping I find the strength one day to just tackle my abandoned life head on.

5316,"Root of avpd and life-damaging thoughts I had M21. My problem with avpd is that it made me weak, defenseless, I feel like prey living among predators.
My self esteem is low and I know how it can be increased, it ""just"" requires me to be strong and all the problems will eventually disappear.

I was bullied by two different group of people, I realize now the reason was that they instantly saw my weakness, the second time I was bullied by my friends (at that time), initially they even respected me cause I was serious, but when you can't defend yourself it looks pathetic and I even can see their perspective, you just need to be more tough and confident (without any reason).

This experience reflected in my thoughts I was living with till recently:
when I was a kid I thought you need to really know how to dance, know the technique or some kind of particular style but thinking about my stupid rural relatives refuted it, cause how they being so stupid could think about it really, it's not possible, but they fuck, I don't.

second was about clothes, hypebeasts.
I thought classmates were making fun of me cause I looked weird, lame. Even though it's not fully wrong I just exaggerated it on a new extreme level. There wasn't particularly anything wrong with my clothes, I just couldn't understand their reaction.

Third was about thinking that the group of people knew something that I missed, or like there was some hidden context I was unaware of. It was a constant thought when I was with my peers.

I also has such problem that I often can't decide when I should feel offended and when not, it's important cause it can really lead to being a punching bag. This is also a beginning of my PPD part of personality. This kind of thinking leads to paranoia.

I hope I won't regret posting this. Maybe it's the only time I can be honest.",3

5318,"When manic, do any of you have trouble reading body language, facial expressions or interpreting tone? I feel the root cause of this is paranoia caused by mania, at least in my case.

I have experienced misinterpreting facial expressions, body language and tone whilst interacting with people, and tend to jump to conclusions, typically negative ones.

For example, I was waiting in line for ice cream today, and the woman in front of me turned around, looked me up and down and then scoffed at me.

I don’t know if this interaction actually happened like I perceived it. My initial feeling was this woman was judging me. 

This of course pissed me off, but instead of starting a fight with her, I decided to take a deep breath, left my place in line and walked the opposite direction. 

I decided the ice dream wasn’t worth possibly getting into an altercation with a stranger.

1. Will take and take and take and ask for more and state I don’t do anything. 

2. Will never do nice gestures for me, such as offer to pick me up, drop me off, take me to lunch. Be affectionate. Anything really. 

3. Treat me like a doormat. Cancel plans on me last minute, prioritize commitments with random people,  disregard my feelings/thoughts. (We’re moving in and our place is going to be used as a business place with clients sitting in the living room all day and evening). 

4. Never take any responsibility, always contort discussions, criticisms, and play victim. 

I understand a lot of AvPD behaviors are rooted in shame and self doubt but I don’t see how that applies to the above behaviors.

I would describe her as a high functioning AvPD. I’ve read some posts from similar people and by her own words “she feels like she is wearing a mask around other people all the time”. 
Also seems she’s used to using and disregarding partners/men. Her life long friend called her out on this.

***EDIT***

I needed some clarity and validation! I do not think this is AvPD which is why I had to ask. Also was looking for experiences from those in similar situations with mine or those with AvPD.

5323,"Travel Tips? How do you handle barking security agents, boarding passes, changing itinerary, foreign languages, rude locals, etc. without losing it? Here's what's worked for me:

Photograph \*everything\* important - passports, credit cards, boarding passes, luggage, and store the photos in a locked folder on your phone. This helps recovery of lost items, lower your footprint if you get robbed, and it creates backups because you never know.

Try to research as much ahead of time - Rick Steves advises to book the important stuff, but keep things open ended. I've found, since I'm so easily distracted, to have a few good options at all times that you can do in case things are getting weird. 

Go easy on the coffee - first thing I want to do in an airport or a new city is to have coffee. There's downtime, I'm jetlagged, weary, and already overstimulated, and caffeine I think adds to my disorganization. If I get lost, it makes me look even more like a crackhead asking for directions. It's best to get acclimated then act like a local.

Assume you will get lost and account for it - my sense of directions are terrible. Without google maps, I would be at the front of Walmart, aged progressed, with a slightly insulting cash reward for whoever finds me. Set up SIM cards, initial itinerary, and a basic plan to get settled after arrival. 

Breathe, dammit! - everything's new, everything's stimulating, but you have responsibilities. Stay present and take.your.meds. Do you really want to be hospitalized overseas?

5325,"recently diagnosed &amp; very anxious when it comes to meds hey all.

i was recently diagnosed. to sum up my dilemma, my entire life anytime i’ve had a medical problem arise, i’ve always been dismissed as it being “anxiety”. i have a history of unexplained syncope episodes &amp; wacky blood test results but no doctor has ever taken me seriously. perks of being a 22 year old female. i’ve been told to take antidepressants for viral illnesses &amp; the like. so i’ve grown costumed to having a distrust towards doctors or i feel like they just use me for money &amp; don’t listen to me, ya know?

anyway, that’s not why i’m here. i hit rock bottom a few months ago &amp; have been seeing a wonderful therapist who truly advocates for me &amp; gives me a voice. he referred me to a psychologist &amp; we did the whole genesight thing. she wants me to start taking latuda.

i did the whole googling the medicine thing &amp; asked some friends about it, &amp; i have yet to see a good review. i also don’t want to be even more tired than i am now as i’m exhausted 24/7 as is. &amp; im scared meds could impact work or school.

i guess i’m just here asking for validation to ease my anxiety. will meds actually help me? or will i feel miserable? i’m really scared. i’m so hyper aware of my body &amp; i freak out about any minor change, even headaches. but also as the months go on the more i feel wildly reckless &amp; isolated. if i start taking them, &amp; want to get off them, will they forever change me like antidepressants can? i’d rather enjoy my few months of mania no matter how wild it can be vs forever be different..

Some brief background info:
I have autism so I may not always understand all social cues. Neither my friend nor I live in the US.

I have a friend going through a hard time right now. He has depression and recently has been experiencing all sorts of physcial issues.

I cannot support him financially since i also have almost no money.
 Whenever i talk to him he gives short and/or snappy answers and is generally in a bad mood. Whenever I talk about positive things, it feels preachy or that I'm ""rubbing happiness in his face"". Whenever i try to talk about neutral things  (basically small talk) the conversation dies off. So he's understandably a bit difficult to talk to as of late.

The school I was in offered an internship for a class in marketing, and I took it (honestly, anything to make my portfolio and resume look good). Not going to lie; the internship was fun and exciting, so when they offered me an entry-level position in marketing, I was hesitant. I didn't study marketing or advertising or anything related to that, just filmmaking. They knew that I only had knowledge of film but still wanted to give me a chance to explore my career options. Now, having been here for a year, I've built up an extreme amount of stress.

Every single day I am constantly feeling stressed, anxious, and depressed. I'm always messing up, and it has gotten to the point where I received a PIP. I saw it coming. 

I am struggling with my grammar, not being strong enough when it comes to presenting, and lacking creativity. Things are so rushed here that I often miss a thing or two, which reflects poorly on me. Being dyslexic doesn't help either. As a result, I received a PIP, and it has spiked my stress levels and anxiety to the point where I feel sick every day. I can't eat, don't feel like getting out of bed, can't breathe, can't sleep, and can't think clearly.

Additionally, I have been struggling with a yeast infection for six months (yes, you read that right). My doctor says I have a candida overgrowth, so I am on a strict diet in hopes of getting it under control.

The whole experience is making me feel like a failure, like I've made a big joke out of myself. My manager talked to me and said that copywriting marketing isn't for me because I didn't learn it, and he knows my skills lie elsewhere. I agree, but I am afraid I won't find a job in film with how the economy is and the difficult hiring process I see on social media. It's terrifying. How am I going to pay for school, debt, help my parents, pay for groceries for this stupid candida diet, and help my grandma in Mexico, and more bills?

My parents and a coworker of mine are giving me words of encouragement and saying that everything is going to be okay. They say I should still be proud because I tried something new, created a new set of skills, and toughened up. I don't know if that's true.",0
5362,I go back to college in 2 weeks and I don’t know if I’m gonna be able to pay off my unpaid balance before registration for the upcoming semester ends. Title says it all. I’m beyond stressed because even if I am able to pay the money it won’t be until the day before registration ends and even then I would have already missed a whole week of classes and be behind. I asked them if I could instead have a payment plan and still be able to register for classes for this upcoming semester while paying off the unpaid balance for last semester and they said no. I’ve been working everyday at my job and just putting it towards the balance but it seems like nothing is enough. College is a scam,0

Tonight, I was going down the road at 38mph in a 40 zone, and the truck behind me kicked in his high Beams. The car ahead of me was about 5 car lengths up and decided to stop to turn and I didn't see it because I was being blinded by the bat signal behind me and I was trying to fiddle with the anti glare mirror. He stopped, no turn signal or any reason why, but I fucked up and slammed on my brakes. Hit him. I already had one set back this year. No collision coverage.

I grew up always walking behind my group of friends. I could never do anything apart from others. In any social situation it has always been my role to be the child in the corner or the one following the parents.
It doesn't help my father is a controlling sexist. I've never slept out my own house, never dated someone openly (afraid he would beat me up), never visited my friends houses (I don't even know if I can call them friends).
I'm nerdy but not smart. I always got high grades in school, but I never liked being complimented on it because I thought most of my grades came from the cheating sheets I made to remember the subjects before the exams.
If I have to talk with someone for anything, I have a script in my head I have to follow to ensure I'm not saying anything idiot.
After graduating from school, I fell for my relative's advice and did not leave my hometown, preferring to go to college in the neighboring city and work with that relative. Well, we had a fight and I had to quit uni cuz I was fired.
I couldn't muster up the strength to deliver resumes in my city due to sheer shyness.
Five years have passed since then. I'm almost 23 years old. I'm just a high school graduate. No professional course taken, no money in hand, living with my parents...I still don't want to hand out resumes, I don't want to get in touch with people... I long for physical contact, but I don't have the courage to get close to anyone...

Welp, they got us

But my collegue is not by boss right? Why does the title mention my boss then?

After my collegue arrived, my boss ""dropped in"" xd. He had a conversation with me about me working a little less past month (91h, the limit at my company is 84). He asked me if I'm doing ok and all I was able to think in my head is ""he's checking if I'm not liability and it's one of the last straws, soon I'm going to get fired"". I acutally always feared being fired. The fact that I dropped out of uni and don't have a degree AND this job pays a lot and everyone here is very non-controlling makes it much worse.

5381,"Psychiatrist belittling me First time poster on this sub, but I feel like I need support. Sorry for the format, I am on mobile. 

I feel like my psychiatrist at my most recent appointment was talking to me in a way that made it feel like I was being stupid or taking myself too seriously on what my problems could be. 

I'm diagnosed with a mood disorder and my previous psychiatrist strongly suspected I may be bipolar due to the symptoms I experience. I've been open and shared a lot of my issues with my psychiatrist, but he doesn't seem to care.

What really grinded my gears though was him saying ""well I'm not sure if you really are bipolar because you don't show one of the most common symptoms which is the lack of need for sleep. And I don't mean only needing 5 or 6, I mean more like 2."" To which I had to tell him that no, I have had that back in high school most prominently. I never was diagnosed with bipolar and didn't know what it was before I started my mental health journey, so at the time I didn't think much of having little to no sleep when younger and figured it was normal to go a day or two without sleeping. 

To which he asks me ""well how did that change over the course of time?"" It's called forcing myself to get tired by mentally or physically exerting a lot and also becoming a single parent helps with getting tired a lot faster.

 I felt horrible and hurt because it felt like I had to justify to myself that I'm not crazy, that it's not normal to struggle going to bed before midnight, that feeling crazy swings back and forth isn't normal. I have an appointment with my therapist tomorrow and I feel like expressing to him how the psych treated me made me feel like I'm being stupid or blowing things out of proportion. I hate this and I hate feeling out of control of my own emotions most of the time, and I just want to be taken seriously. I see now why so many women struggle to get diagnosed; ""it's all in your head"" or ""that's just normal for a woman to be moody""

5388,"Young bipolar woman hoping for future Hello everyone 

First, I'm French, so sorry if my english is not perfect perfect. 

I'm 24 years old, living in Paris and apparently bipolar type 1 with intense psychotic features. 

My life was almost totally hell for several years, after my diagnosis. 

The doctors didn't correctly adjust my medication, and I already have undergo more than 2 very big  crisis. Since we have discovered that I needed neuroleptic, my life has changed for the best. 

Despite my age, I'm still in an undergraduate program at university.  In fact, my disease has caused many issues during my school and university years. I would love to become a ""documentarian"" (somebody who work in the field of documentation, information...). I want to have my first job, in the public domain, in less than two or three years. 

I have a boyfriend since 5 years, and I would love to build a life with him. He's already working since several years, so I'm eager to work, so we can ""advance"".

I would like to have a family, one or two children, and a house, in a place that we would love. 

BUT I have to be realistic. Since my diagnosis, I had more than 2 very big crisis, and many littles ones. 

I have decided since two years to perfectly take my traitement. So my life is better now. But in 2022, I had a hypomaniac and next mixte episode, which cause many problems in my study program. I'm in the obligation to do one year in two years, because I have too much delay. 

To be precise, my doctor and I had change Zyprexa to Abilify. The Abilify was at 15mg, the lithium that I take too was too low....So there was a crisis. Now, I'm hoping that the augmentation of lithium and Abilify will be relevant and protective for the years to come. 

Moreover, I decided to establish a more protective routine. I began yoga, stopped alcool...

But I really need to be stable in the years to come in order to succeed in my academics, and in my life in general.

Do you think it is possible ? Are my dreams impossible ? Do you think my stabilization in the long run is possible ? 

I precise that recently, a doctor said me that with this treatment, it wasn't impossible to be stabilized for me, but I don't know if I can believe him.",2

I don’t really believe that anyone would want to be around me or understand why they would, which also clouds my view. I feel like having friends is so painful for me because I’m always feeling like they don’t want me around &amp; not knowing if I should just completely stop talking to them if we haven’t talked a lot lately or if any aspect of our dynamic shifts.

5400,"Telling people you are bipolar I just wanted like opinions/consensus on this cuz I’m curious. Who in your life do you tell that you are bipolar?

I work in healthcare and hear the way people talk about bipolar patients all the time I don’t have many Gen-Z coworkers for context most Gen-X, boomers, or millennials and it’s abysmal. (I’m a millennial for context). They talk about us the same way people would talk about people convicted for domestic abuse, or a hit and run or a violent crime. Just disdain. So I would never tell anyone at work that and broadly speaking these people are supposed to be empathetic and nice healthcare workers. So I feel like I have a pretty good idea of what people actually think of us when they don’t have to be politically correct about it cuz they know they aren’t speaking to people who will be directly hurt or offended by what they have to say. 

I’ve noticed younger people like people on tik tok or like just in general not only talk about it but put it front and center as a key piece of their identity. They put it in cover letters that go out to job applications and to me this just seems wildly naïve. I wish we didn’t live in that world but we have negative stereotypes about being late being unreliable or substance abuse issues and even though a lot of us don’t do those things often or at all. 

People who have power to dictate important parts of our lives like what jobs and opportunities we have will go with default assumptions like those and will go with the “safer pick” the person who doesn’t specify that or the one who doesn’t have that info readily available on tik tok youtube insta Facebook.

I don't know how much of it is due to the condition itself (if AvPD is even the right label for my specific brand of brokenness), and how much of it is due to objective differences related to the fairly unusual path I've taken through life.

Also, Reddit is regarded to have a kind of 'hive mind', where posters tend to express similar views in similar ways to the point where it's difficult to distinguish individuals. I see myself as an outsider looking at that from a distance, but do any of you see yourself as being a part of that?

If you don't feel you fit in, why is that, specifically? What details about you clash with what you perceive as the Reddit or r/AvPD culture(s)?

And if you DO feel you fit in, especially on Reddit in general, how does that relate to your AvPD? Is it easier to wear a metaphorical mask as a part of a collective, something like that?

5413,"Had a really bad turn the last few days Hi everyone, I've had anxiety for the last 6 months or so in varying levels. From January I was in a decent headspace with it but the last three weeks it's got worse and then the last four days or so it's gone off a cliff. 

It's all I think about all day long, I had panic attacks on Monday and Wednesday and my heart is racing all day. Where before I'd wake up rested now I wake up with my heart racing and frequently my muscles are spasming which is scary. The thought of doing normal stuff feels impossible and I can't shake this feeling I can't get better than this ever again. 

I spoke to my doctor on Thursday and he prescribed propranolol which I took yesterday for the first time which helped with the body stuff but my mind was still racing.

Has anyone experienced similar and have any tips? I feel like this is really really bad and worse than most people have anxiety.",4

anyway. i was heading out for my break on saturday, and i got my marlboros out of my locker. (smoking is bad, i know). i bought them off a friend of a friend who stocked up on her trip to italy. so i turned to my coworker (notoriously one of if not the most outgoing in our little crew), and said ""hey, check these out."" and i showed him the picture of the blackened lung on the carton, and we kind of joked about how fucked up it is that those kinds of health warnings are the norm in other countries, but not here (USA).

 i don't really know what was different this time. it must have been a beneficial glitch, because i haven't shown that degree of spontaneity since, especially not while 100% sober.

I was making decent progress too. I was going to groups and started volunteering to get out of my house and around people again. I'm trying to work up to going back to work.

I'm kind of just stuck in a period of regression after making some strides. I don't know what to do it just feels hopeless.

I used to smoke about half a pack a day fairly reliably, but in the wake of a very stressful cross-country move, my consumption spiked to 20-25 smokes a day and I haven’t been able to get it back down yet.  I have BP1 with psychotic features and my own therapist said he doesn’t know anyone with a psychotic mood disorder that doesn’t smoke, so I’m not sure if actually quitting is in my future.  I’ve tried before using patches and after two weeks I felt like I had a rabid rat scratching around in my head.  However, I do think getting back to half a pack or less is doable.  My current plan is two-fold: replace some of my daily smokes with nicotine gum, and instead of having the whole pack with me out on the porch where I smoke, I keep them inside and only take 2 with me outside.  When I’m done I’ll set a phone timer for 2 hours and not smoke until it goes off.  Hopefully this will get me down to around 15 or less a day at which point I’ll either smoke every 3 hours or only have one at a time (perhaps both!).  My therapist is a big fan of the harm reduction method of dealing with substance use.  Yes, I know that any smoking at all is bad for me, but so is completely losing my mind and raging: it’s a balance.

Does anyone have any thoughts regarding my plan or any additional tips that may be helpful?  I’ve been smoking since I was a teenager (now 51) so it’s a deeply ingrained habit.

But I am trying to make up for it, and I offered to do lunch Sunday (he's accepted).

I'm unsure if I told him about my disorder, and honestly, I think he'd not get AvPD anyways. I have had many experiences telling people about AvPD and they just sort of give a ""well-meaning, but not getting it"" nod.

Going out feels like I'm forcing myself to hatch too soon and I just imagine myself as this gooey half-baked butterfly if I try to go out now. I want to get to my full form to go out and about.

5484,"Does anyone else ever get thoughts like “I don’t deserve to be walking down this hallway… I’m not important enough.” I think this is like a generalized imposter syndrome. Typically people feel like an imposter in their field of work, but this would be like that in all cases. I have a pretty underdeveloped sense of self.


While we’re at it, does anybody else constantly smile in social situations to minimize the chances of having to deal with hostility, danger, or stress from the other person? I just had the thought recently that this is why I smile constantly while talking to people. I recall the first time somebody asked me why I smiled all the time. I genuinely had no idea that I was smiling, but that would explain why people are usually cheerful around me! Apparently, this is referred to as “fawning”.",3
5485,I had a mini win ! Hello everyone I hope you’re okay. I was just playing FIFA and boom a big palpitation hit I started to panic felt lightheaded because I was holding my breath because I was so tense and then calmed down. I have had my heart checked 7 times 2 of which are private best testing ones and it’s perfect so I know it’s not going to harm me but still catches me off guard I think it’s more of the fact I was leaning forward that it felt harder and the fact I was breathing in lol. Anyway ! I was laying in bed thinking I need to just once and for all get over all of the symptoms that are making me scared of being I’ll and dying. How can I do that ???? GET OVER MY FEAR OF DYING now I’m not saying I’m perfectly fine with death because I am not but I just thought to myself I can’t stop death and I just need to accept it. If there isn’t a god I won’t know about dying after if there is a God I could go to heaven which is great and who knows I could reincarnate and live life again. We don’t know so it’s the anxiety of not knowing which scares me and leaving my family behind. Like I say I’m a healthy 22 year old male with NO health conditions death can happen at anytime and could happen the next minute but for my age and health it is unlikely but never zero. Now I’m religious and I am sort of anxious in my mind that God is trying to get me to accept death so I can die soon lol but I don’t wanna die soon that’s why I’m scared off. That’s just my anxious mind thinking right ? I guess the positive way of looking at it is that God is getting me to get over my fear of death so I can live the LONG HAPPY HEALTHY LIFE that he put out for me. Can anyone help me accept death even more ?,4

5489,"I systematically throw up before having a Zoom meeting with my soon-to-be PHD supervisor Before anyone asks, no, the problem is not coming from my supervisor. He’s kind, willing to help and available for me. 

If you ask me I wouldn’t even say that I feel stressed before the meetings, in the sense that I’m not overthinking, I’m not having this bowl of stress in my belly that one could have facing pressure. 

Yet I don’t know why, systematically, 10-5 minutes before the meeting, I go to the toilet and I throw up everything I have, even if I had a light breakfast before. I really don’t know what can I do to stop this because it doesn’t feel like the problem is coming from me. It feels like I have no other choice but to throw up. 

Obviously it’s linked to the fact that I’m going to apply to a PhD and the fact that he’s a very knowledgeable man in his field, and there’s probably a bit of impostor syndrome playing. But what’s worrying me is the fact that of all the 10-12 meetings we had so far, I systematically throw up. I’ve had other meetings with other supervisors when I was a research assistant for instance and it didn’t happen probably because the stakes are lower. What can I do to feel better ?",0

All these years of youth wasted doing nothing. Tired of how competitive everything is, because I’m tired of fighting. Left behind by people who said they would always be there, until it wasn’t convenient anymore. Broke, ugly, tired and burnt out on this life. Maybe it could be worse, but that just makes me hate life more. Everyone acts like you have an obligation to this life. You’re obligated to get a job, make money, make a life for yourself. But I never asked for this life in the first place. I wish I could go back now, to that moment I was about to be born and press a button to cancel my life before it started.

I've been suffering with anxiety and panic attacks my whole life, and while I take a ridiculous amount of meds for it including lorazapam, pregablin etc, I was informed about Magnesium and I wanted to share this with you.

So a lot of us get anxiety attacks triggered by the stress hormone cortisol, magnesium works by by stimulating the production of melatonin and serotonin which boost your mood and help you sleep. Magnesium also reduces the production of cytokines and cortisol, which lead to increased inflammation and stress.

It's important that you don't over do it as you can poison yourself with magnesium, and you also have to make sure it's aspartate, citrate, lactate, and chloride forms as oxide apparently doesn't absorb as well.

Speak to your pharmacist or Dr if you're mixing medication, but I have been able to reduce the amount of lorazapam I've needed since starting mag and its helped a lot with sleep. I'm truly impressed.",4
5503,"Wanting to be Normal It’s been a weird year. The world became a hotbed of viral death and I got diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I mean, apparently I just couldn’t let the pandemic upstage me.

I’ve tried to deny who I am for the past 10 years. If you had to label me, I often am described as an extreme extrovert. All my friends tell me they “don’t know how I do it.” I stay out until 2am, go to bed at 3am, and wake up for work at 6am multiple days in a row without a problem. I do it all seamlessly, making it look effortless. I’ve never missed a day of work because I was tired or hungover, which is why I can’t stop acting the way I do. I don’t know how to say no. The word is literally not in my vocabulary. My lust to wander, be around friends, and experience everything the world has to offer is insatiable, but in an unhealthy way. 

I used to think that everyone else I knew was lame. I would come up with excuses for them; “they didn’t go to a party college, they’re married, they don’t like techno music.” But ultimately, I would get mad that my friends couldn’t handle social interactions the same way I did. Turns out, everyone I know is just normal and I am bipolar.

Throughout undergrad and graduate school, I normalized my actions as part of the college experience. I still did well in school while partying and sleeping around, so why worry? Promiscuity and drinking is part of college culture, so what if I was a bit extra every now and then?

Recently though, my disease has gotten the best of me. The thoughts in my head won’t go away. I sit there in turmoil knowing that I am being unreasonable, but I am plagued by insecurity, fear of missing out, irritability, anxiety, and no matter how I try to reason through them, they disrupt my life. 

There is such a stigma on not only bipolar disorder, but mental disorders in general that it has made me afraid to try medication. Why can’t I be the way I used to be without medication? Why can’t I feel like myself without taking an antipsychotic? I know we all need a little extra help sometime, but I am scared. I am scared to admit who I really am.",2

5508,"Is freezing during a conversation an AvPD symptom? Hi all! I'm new to this subreddit, I was recently diagnosed with AvPD. I'm trying to understand it and come to terms with it.

The thing is, I don't have social anxiety in terms of not wanting to spend time with people at all... when it's about folks I know, like my colleagues and friends, I'm even more-than-average social.

However, I do notice that I'm... slow in social interactions. I mean that someone will say something and my brain shuts down and I can't answer properly in the moment. Or I can't hear someone properly but I'm too afraid to ask them to repeat themselves (?!) so I just kinda freeze and/or act as if I heard what they said and the conversation goes on. Then later I think of a ""correct"" reaction and can't for my life understand why I shut down during the convo and couldn't just think of this reaction then.

This happens with friends too, although it's more common with folks I'm not that comfortable with. Is this an AvPD thing or just a ""me thing""?

TL;DR Is shutting down during conversations and only thinking of a proper reaction later an AvPD thing?",3

For awhile before my diagnosis I had talked to my doc about ADHD cause I felt I fitted the symptoms of that so was in shock when I was eventually diagnosed with Bipolar.  When on what I call highs I get extremely productive.  I get so much done and take up new hobbies that never last more than a couple of months.  My lows are never so bad I'm depressed, but I have no energy mentally or physically and no interest in doing anything and I fall behind on everything.  The house gets messy and I struggle to achieve anything.

I have 3 kids so my anxiety goes through the roof when things get messy.  I'm snappy to be around for my wife and my mother and I get into moods because everything in the house is messy again.  It's like a vicious circle.  My lows causes me to let the place get untidy and the mess causes me to spiral into worse moods.

But sometimes when I read what other people go through and mine doesn't seem so bad in comparison I start to doubt I even have Bipolar.  These thoughts sneak into my head, I feel like an imposter and that I'm not really as bad as I think, and I'm only lazy, subconsciously tricking people and cheating by being on illness benefit.

A very strange kind of reaction, my hands start to burn (inside my skin, if you touch my hands they are normal temperature), and then they start to itch. They burn and itch so much I end up putting them under water constantly. 

I started taking some antihistamines with it and I've been ok for three years. This med has changed my life, like entirely. It made me stable, able to hold a job, and so much more. I can't live without it. 

But recently, my hands started to itch again. Slowly. I take my antihistamine in the evening, I'm fine all day long the following day, and then in the evening it starts to itch again. My overall skin as well. 

I'm worried I will have to stop taking my Lamictal. It has been wonderful. No side effects whatsoever. If I stop taking it, I won't take any other medication because I don't want to gain weight, or hurt my kidneys.

No one blames themselves for their kid dying of cancer. People have so much compassion and sympathy for people with cancer. Why is it that the same compassion isn't extended to people with incurable, lifelong, crippling mental illness? Why does someone's pain have to be cosmetically obvious for people to care, or even believe it's real?

I'm struggling because everything I've studied about my disorder whether in my books or online or from my doctor, it's difficult to believe that because my family has always been the tough love kind. My father is never okay with me using the word Bipolar disorder and has always said to call it depression because it's just that. My sister who is also a doctor also often tells me that my symptoms are anxiety and the common statement by both of them as well as my mom is that people have it worse than I am.
 I've been working on my post grad exams and I'm struggling. I have difficulty recalling and retaining what I read and I have gotten several anxiety attacks. My family history is positive for bpd but currently its just me. 
I'm completely lost because i don't know if I'm stupid or not. My brain gets too loud sometimes, I am scared of fightings and driving as well as being driven, I'm told I'm too talkative.

I've tried so many things but nothing ""releases"" it. I have one of those shoulder massagers from Amazon - it actually feels quite good especially when it rolls up my neck - but I feel like I can do it **forever** and there is just infinite tension there - shouldn't it ""stop"" at some point?

Things I tried:

* PT
* Chiro
* Neck/Shoulder Massager
* Stretches
* Heat pads (these actually help a little but I don't think I should be walking around every day with heat pads..maybe I can?)
* Magnesium Oil
* Like 6 different pillows - none of them result in me waking up without a stiff neck. Down pillows, thin, thick, memory foam, nothing!
* Foam roller
* Theracane/tennis balls

5557,"Switching meds, planning pregnancy, and moving across country. Recipe for disaster? For context I have type one and a history of 4 hospitalisations in 7 years. ECT (worked amazingly but only for a while), tried loads of medications and it seems like we've finally found a combo that works. I haven't had a serious episode for over two years now. 

I have a two year old son and, despite the manic episode I had after four days is labour when he was born, he's the best thing that has ever happened to my mental health. I love him to bits even though he was a surprise and I was totally sure I wasn't ready.

Now my husband and I want a sibling for him. We both never had siblings of our own, so he has no cousins and we both wish we had siblings. We want a baby sooner rather than later because the age gap keeps getting bigger. 3 years difference is ok, but 4 seems like much more to me. I don't know. I've started taking folic acid and we should be ready to start trying to conceive in May. 

We also happen to be moving across the UK for my husband's work in July. If all goes well, I could be pregnant by then.

I told my psychiatrist this and he told me that my antidepressant, clomipramine, is dangerous to the baby in pregnancy and can cause serious heart defects. He wants to switch me to an SSRI (citalopram), which I've tried several of and they haven't done much for me in the past. Clomipramine worked for me I think because it's also effective in OCD and while I don't have OCD, my depressive thoughts are definitely obsessive. I've been taking clomipramine for since a mild depressive episode I had a year ago and since I haven't had any depression at all and I haven't gone manic either.

I'm just worried with the move (even though I'm really looking forward to it) and the pregnancy and the medication change might be too much. As a mother, I feel having a serious episode is not an option, but then am I just putting more pressure on myself? Is this crazy? Should I try it or wait another year with the baby? Even just changing medication worries me, but I can't consider pregnancy without doing that first.

I don't know exactly what I'm asking for here. Reassurance? Sanity check? Advice? Any and all of that is welcome.",2

5576,"I think I have AvPD (avoidant personality disorder) I have recently come across AvPD and I realized that I relate to almost all of the symptoms. First off, I’m very anxious in almost all social situations. This includes hanging around friends i’ve known for many many years, being around extended family (who i’ve also known for many years), being around coworkers, meeting new people, and even just going grocery shopping. 

I often try to avoid a lot of social situations which has definitely affected a lot of my relationships. I’m not very close with my friends or family anymore. I still hangout with them sometimes but it’s not on a very deep level. I don’t really open myself up to anyone. I’m scared of people figuring out my true personality and that they won’t like me for who I am. I hide lots of parts of my personality and not one person on this earth truly knows me. I’m close enough with my parents that I don’t get anxious around them, however I still hide many pieces of myself and don’t feel comfortable enough to show everything about myself. 

I have also struggled to find jobs that don’t make me anxious. It took me until I was 18 years old until I finally got my first job because of this. I currently work at a daycare and have worked here for about 7 months and my anxiety has seemed to get worse. I have been thinking about quitting for awhile now but am terrified of having the conversation with my boss about quitting. 

Whenever I’m at work, I feel inferior to everyone else. I feel like I have less experience, I overthink everything, and I am so awkward around my coworkers and parents. I feel like I’m incompetent and people don’t take me seriously because of my poor communication skills. My mind often goes blank when I’m asked questions and I don’t feel like I’m much of a help. I also try to focus completely on the kids and I would rather not form any real relationships with other coworkers. I try to keep conversations polite and small. I rarely talk about myself either, just enough to get by. I play it safe.

I had a falling out with my family so I'm essentially NC with them, and on top of that I recently moved to an entirely new state. I had to sell a lot of my belongings that helped me cope with my depression, such as my laptop and PS5. 

My partner is a fantastic person and the moments I get to spend with him everyday are a blessing. He has similar issues,  but I insisted he kept his computer since that's his lifeline. On top of that, he has numerous social circles who adore him.

I've been having a terrible depression spout just due to the new location and lack of socializing, and it stings when I'm awake at night sad and alone,  and I hear him talking to one of his many friend groups. They play games, have fun, just hang out. He'll do this all night, and I have to sleep and wake up to him having fun.

I asked him to keep his belongings and I love that he has friends, but I just get so upset that he has things that I just cannot have - a loving family, friends who would never replace him, games he can play - it makes me so irrevocably depressed that I just can't have those things for some reason. I have autism, ADHD and social anxiety and I try to communicate my jealousy to him but at the end of the day, it isn't his problem. I want him to be happy but I'm upset that he can do these things, which is shitty of me to even feel.

How do I get over it? How do you even make friends when you're just a piece of shit person with no good qualities? I'm tired of being so damn lonely.

 I have a crush on a girl. My brother is friend's with her brother. My brother and her are also friends and seem to talk often. 

She had a crush on and liked my brother at some point, maybe she still does, I have no idea. 

Sadly, we never really talk or anything, especially outside of social gatherings where the whole ""group"" is already hanging out. I spoke directly to her, and vice versa a handful of times yesterday while we were all hanging out. 

It was kind of me just speaking for the sake of speaking, I didn't go out of my way to do it too much though because I was very anxious, nervous, and insecure around her.

Anyway, we've never interacted on social media, and she hasn't followed me or anything even though she probably knows that I have some social media accounts, for example, on Twitter she has most likely seen me reply to my brother's tweets.

Am I just being childish and over-analyzing social media?

5607,"I got a stern reminder that being stable doesn’t mean I am cured I recently had to lower my lithium (under doctor supervision) because my lithium level was too high. I started to notice that I felt less numb. I felt butterflies in my stomach and a warm, fuzzy happy for the first time since I was a teenager. It was intoxicating. So I thought to myself, maybe I don’t need my lithium anymore. I never tried stopping it completely after ECT. This was a bad plan…

For the last few days I felt something I hadn’t felt in a long time too. The overwhelming depression, self hatred and urge to harm myself. It was terrifying. And I found I was completely out of practice in suppressing those feelings. 

Back on my lithium… I am the first one to advocate taking your pills so I feel like a hypocrite. I have been reminded that deep in my mind bipolar is still there and still capable of destroying me. It was humbling, terrifying and discouraging all at the same time. Today I mourn the fact that I will never be able to fully feel emotions and will always have to be “sedated” to some degree. I shouldn’t complain because at least I have stability. But that taste of what life is really supposed to feel like and knowing I will never have it has left me in a bad way. I feel ungrateful for the stability I have and greedy for the way I used to feel before getting sick.

&amp;#x200B;

I follow the little brother who is 16 on Instagram and we occasionally interact (liking stories, pics,etc). Yesterday I remembered that my friends and I created a 'burner' account 3 years ago that we used to look and follow people we didn't know (crazy I know). 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I noticed that Jake was following this burner. I looked at his profile as saw a bunch of stuff posted that I have never seen before. It was typical teenage boy stuff like rap music, middle fingers in pictures, etc. but nothing that I haven't seen before. I realized that I was blocked from viewing these stories and unblocked whenever he posted other stuff. I instantly started to feel sick and uneasy at the thought him blocking and unblocking me each time. I even felt a little teary. I thought, does he think I am uncool? Old? Did he think I was going to tell his mom? I also post things with cursing etc. so I really felt confused. I know in reality it is really not that deep because I too have older adults in my life 'blocked' from viewing my story but the feeling I felt was uncontrollable. 

I don't want to feel like this anymore. I have felt similar to this in other occasions and another user asked if I had rejection sensitive dysphoria. I am not sure if I do.

5624,"Going to the cinema This is probably a very particular issue and I’ve never really wanted to post about my anxiety but I’ve led myself here anyway. After a weed induced panic attack about 5 months ago, things have been pretty hellish for me. I’ve got a painful feeling in my chest I would say the majority of the day (anxiety, of course), every day.  Now, I love love LOVE films. I plan to go to college next year and study film. I’ve wanted to become a director for years now. As you’d imagine, that requires me to be able to watch pretty much any kind of film, whenever. But, going to the cinema, something I hold so close to my heart as being a place I used to love, a place I would go to escape, has become really difficult for me. I really struggle in the days leading up to going, takes serious mental preparation. I’ve been a total of 6 times in 2023, which to people who know me, is simply unheard of. I’m a big fan of the John Wick films and have plans to go see the 4th one tomorrow. I’ve been waiting a long time to see it, but I just can’t see myself actually going out and seeing it. If you’re aware of the John Wick films, you know that they’re probably the most “foot on the gas” and brutal action films around. Which I feel is going to really freak me out. In my experiences of going to the cinema with anxiety, I’ve never had to leave the cinema. I’m pretty uncomfortable being there but I’ve never had to leave. I think that the main thing is the fear that this thing I love so much is being taken from me, despite me having no evidence to support it. While I’ve been able to push myself to go all the other times, I just can’t see it happening this time. I know it’s a lot of mental gymnastics but if anyone has ANYTHING to tell me at all I’d really appreciate it.

I feel like AvPD is just that we learned things incorrectly, we were exposed to some very stressful situations as child and our brains learned that that situation this is bad.

And now our functioning brain is reminding us with anxiety that this situation is familiar from past when we were learning things. And this anxiety is causing us to avoid these situations because we were learnt that they are bad.

5640,"Stress Relief in Making Things So last year, I went to a diner with my gf and I had myself a cappuccino for the first time. I've never tasted anything so delicious and I made it a goal to learn how to go about making one. After Christmas, I got myself an espresso machine. It would be a few months before I used it (lack of space where I live) but I finally got it set up back in November. My first drink, well... I never used a steam wand before. I watched some YouTube videos, my second cup was EXACTLY like what I had at that diner. Now I make about 3 cups a week or so (usually to keep warm more than anything) and it's expanding to where I got a coffee grinder so I'm not restricted by grind. If I want whole beans, I can work with them now. If I'm unsure what grind the bag I have is, pour some in the grinder to make sure.

Was it expensive? Well, getting everything together was about $260. With all the payment apps out there, it's affordable. You can make tons of stuff too. Lattes, mochas, I'll make hot chocolate with this thing. And I love it. If I have guests, I always offer to make them something. I found zen in the process, satisfaction in these product, and a desire to expand on what I know. It really makes me feel better knowing I can make something that not only I can enjoy, but friends and family can as well.

My advice? Learn a craft that you enjoy. If you like painting or even coloring, there's plenty of resources. If you like writing, maybe get a voice recorder for story ideas that pop up and expand on that for a bit. If you like food, all kinds of classes out there.

I just only ever feel so slightly motivated for 2-3hr at a time. and I live with my mother so i don’t have much real reason to get out and do anything because she seems completely fine with supporting me (which I still often feel bad about still depending on her).

5650,"How do I get better? I am 18, from Brazil, currently doing architecture. I have depression and anxiety, probably ADHD too, but still need to do the tests again. I was taking medication since mamy years ago. Got discharged at the begging of the year before starting college, had to get back at it again after starting the course. I took the same meds as before which I used for years, but my body didn't understand that I have already took then before and had some side effects that scared me and I stopped taking one of the meds. Then after the end of my 1st semester I was looking worse with my depression, so my psychiatrist decided to give me adult depression meds... safe to say it backfire extraordinarily, I just turned 18, barely a month ago. 

Went to other doctors and and the 1st side effect went away, but the adult medication gave me more and worse side effects, so again me psychiatrist suggested changing meds. My mom already had some bad impressions on the doctor so after they tried to change again with no wait to see if I'd get better, she told me to stop taking any meds altogether.

I get why, my appetite is lower than usual and I am super sensible to climate and temperature, my intestines are hurting and my head aches everyday. So I am currently on the process of adapting.

This makes me feel like I have to. I am seriously going insane. Yes, I have been diagnosed with pure O since age 14. I’m 25 now.

A social reject with no skills, anxiety, derealization and a bland personality. Nothing about me is enthralling.  I am waisting my youth trapped in my room, left to rot by my own kind. I get possessive, obsessive and moody all the time but I swear i can’t control myself. Either mania or depression, I am always alone. Nobody is rescuing me.

I am in therapy and my therapist tells me not to worry about it anymore, but I can’t help but feel I deserve punishment for what I did. Like, to lose a partner, not have a family, etc. I feel like it’s just for me to lose out on something because she got something taken away too. I definitely faced consequences - the teachers didn’t like me as much afterwards and I got excluded from a party as well.

I keep punishing myself and wonder if there’s a karmic force out there that will punish me. Do I deserve punishment? Should I just let myself be happy? I feel like I don’t deserve to be happy. I’m not sure if this is my anxiety talking though.

It’s like I just want to skip to the “good” part. I feel like the work is only productive/useful when it’s good.

How do you even deal with the uncomfortable parts of learning and growing? :( 

I just keep pushing on but sometimes it feels like I’m making no progress at all. And I know that “slow progress is still progress” but then my anxiety kicks in with bullsh*t like “other people are staying up and working their asses off while you’re celebrating a tiny step forward.”",4

im currently unsure if it’s because im not on the right meds or the amount of pressure im under rn. i feel horrible bc i havent been going to any of my college classes these past 2.5 weeks. i have also not been completing assignments which is also bringing me down. i just dont have the energy for it rn. the stress im under is due to my grades dropping and the possibility of me losing my full ride scholarship

we went on spring break and i was the happiest ive ever been w/o being manic. once school kicked in ive been sleeping in all day. i really think my episode is due to stress rather than my meds. but god it sucks so badly. it just reminds me of how bad my episodes used to be.

-dumped by my now ex, I genuinely cared for, it was a lovely relationship. Was single 4 years prior and I thought I finally found something real and long term

-started a new job. Love it so it's just happy stress 

-enrolled in upgrading so I can return to school next fall. Freaking out because I don't want to leave town for the 2 year program.

-just lonely. To a depth I cannot explain, it's something you must have experienced yourself because I never could imagine this myself.

5712,"Impulse control issues I'm (27F) having serious issues with impulse control. So much so that since I've started my new job, my motto has been ""the less I talk, the better"". So I've been making sure to hold on on words as much as possible. I'm really anxious in general in my social interactions because I seek constant reassurance and approbation, that it's not hard for me not to talk when I'm anxious. 

I've been at my new job for a little more than a year now, and I'm starting to relax around people. I'm more comfortable. And more comfortable means losing my filter slowly. I surprise myself with my reactions that are out of proportion, and it surprises people whom have known me as someone really silent. 

My personality? I talk A LOT. I can be very insensitive and agressive. I WILL do everything I need to be better than whoever is around me. I want to be prettier, the nicest, the funniest, the sweetest, the most intelligent. But that takes constant control. So when I lose it, I go fucking rogue. 

I have a VERY hard time controlling what I say cause my impulse control is absolutely shit. I don't know what to do. Cause that's when people start to lose respect toward me. And that's also when people start to despise me. I want to avoid it as much as possible cause my new job is my dream job and I've been doing amazing until now.

I'm feeling so positive about it. It was painful for the first couple days after no lie, but now I feel great.

I was so worried that I wouldn't be able to make a move sexually, but I did it. It was awkward as hell obviously, but I did it. I was bold as fuck. And it was really no big deal. I saw her again the other day and it was totally cool, no hard feelings.

I finally feel like a real living human being. It's like I've been set free in a major way. Only a year after I asked out the first person haha. Feels like a lifetime ago.

I'm splitting on everyone I know and actively trying to make my situation worse that way I can't come back from it.. (bipolar 2 + BPD) A week and a half ago I was diagnosed with hepatitis c. A deadly virus that costs about $70,000-$90,000 to cure. (I work an entry level retail job and can't afford it)

This diagnosis caused me to go from feeling on top of the world, and stable, to actively wanting to die, feeling that nobody wants me around or loves me, and splitting on everyone around me. 

Today I told the people I'm close to that I'm suicidal, and then I blocked them all. 

I don't want relationships anymore. I always let people down, and I don't feel like anybody ""needs me"". I genuinely don't want to be close to anyone again, because either I get let down, or I let them down, or I push them away.

5731,"Sudden depression? I (f 37) was recently diagnosed due to a hypomanic episode that related in an inpatient stay.
I have been on lamotrigine 3 months.

One day about 2 weeks ago, I woke up depressed, tired, slow, irritated, not caring about anything, etc etc…
Real depression, not a bad mood &amp; not hormonal! 
The depression came on so suddenly, like being hit by a depression-train.

It got worse every day, until I was snapping at colleagues, thinking about not being here etc.
Life was getting unmanageable. 

This kind of depression is nothing new to me, I expected it to last for months. 

On the 9th day, I woke up no longer depressed. 
Completely “normal”. 
Which obviously I am not complaining about… 

Is this sudden onset depression common? 

I am obviously pretty cautious in feeling better, sort of wondering if I am in for a rollercoaster ride over the coming months…?

I’m turning 40 in a few months so I’ve suffered/lived/almost died/laughed through this illness for over 2 decades.  I have a friend who I will call Amy.  Amy was recently diagnosed with generalized anxiety after a stressful life event.  Amy knows about my diagnoses and we are very close, so she has turned to me for questions and emotional support.  I love Amy.  I want to support Amy the best I can.  But the amount of emotional support she is asking for is starting to drain my own mental health resources for staying stable.  Additionally, Amy makes a lot of comments about our experiences being the same and she “gets what’s it’s like for me now” when she very clearly does not.  She is not making these comments from a place of ill intentions.  I know mental illness is not a contest and mental health treatment is important for everyone.  However, I have started to internalize it as “Amy is downplaying everything I’ve been through.”  Does anyone have any advice on how I can support Amy while protecting your own mental health?",2

so yesterday I had a therapy session, and the therapist asked why i think  i have no friends.

i answered i have interests that few share, where i live as i live in a small city, so it is hard to have friends or form relations based on interests. also, i have no interest in sports and that is the common interest where i live 

i told him i am part of many online communities, but i just lurk as i feel that i don't belong enough to participate in  these communities even if they are based on my interests

i was new to reddit and navigating it, but i was happy as i found people like me.

as i kept browsing, i started to get related more and more to your posts. I felt a connection to you,  and i realized i am not alone anymore.

People with who i can share whatever i want, knowing they will understand me and won't judge me

I’m a sales director who recently received a promotion to build and lead a new sales operation for an Australian media company in a foreign country. After relocating my family and settling into our new home, I found the job to be manageable, albeit stressful, for the first 8-9 months.

However, after a year, I've realized that the stress has become a part of my daily routine, and it's starting to change my personality. I'm experiencing burnout, feeling completely drained, unmotivated, and even depressed at times.

Despite being expected to do more with less, the results are still expected.

I'm struggling to decide if I should push through this or throw in the towel. On one hand, the benefits of international experience, such as building and managing a team in a new market and exploring new commercial initiatives, are invaluable. On the other hand, the stress is taking its toll, and I'm not sure if it's worth it.

and now i keep thinking that something is wrong with me. but maybe it’s not BP2?

No one takes me seriously when I say that stuff that's happened to me has negatively affected my mental health. I'm basically told to calm down/ stop worrying, even if it's really affected me. Basically just a refusal to accept and acknowledge that I've been hurt.

5799,"Where did my AvPD come from? So I am officially diagnosed with it but most people on the internet and also my therapist say that it is likely because of a childhood of abusive/narcissistic or in any other way bad parents that resulted in this condition. But I don’t think that it comes from that. I couldn’t have had better parents or family; they supported me, respected my opinion and so on. I have the feeling that I always was like that even in kindergarten back then. The only thing odd about my parents was that they divorced as I was 6 years old (but I guess that’s not the most uncommon thing) and that my father is also very socially avoidant. Could it also be the latter (like in a „learned“ behavior?) or do you think it is more likely that it was something in the past that I just forgot and don’t remember / don’t think is significant enough?
Often I (ironically) feel a bit isolated when I see comments on YouTube or Reddit talking about the reason for the AvPD because I can’t relate at all to their stories (thankfully tho, but you know what I mean)",3

5807,"Who is my first love? Have I fallen in love yet? As someone with AVPD, I have trouble connecting with people. I know I'm smart, and attractive, and I care for people, but it's my lack of social skills that make it hard for people to see the real me. I've had two guys like me back in the past few years. Which one of them would be considered my ""first love""?

The first guy ""Dave"" I met when I was 19 on vacation. He and I would just talk at the pool about politics and education (even though he was kind of a party guy, he has a nerdy side). We only hung out for two days, but after our first day hanging out, the second day, he was really shy talking to me. But our romance was cut short because he had a girlfriend, and made the mistake of spilling the beans about his crush on me to other kids at the resort. He cut off contact with me, but when they broke up a month later, he started looking at my social media a lot. Not to mention, he made a playlist about me for my birthday. We don't even talk, so I don't know if this is some sort of peace offering or apology. 

The second guy ""Steve"" I met a year later, at my job. He and I bonded on the first day of work about growing up in the same hometown, and I told my mom that day about how we bonded over our ""parallel lives"". We worked together for a little over a year. And we never went out or anything, but he would hit on me a lot. But stupid me was either too dense to realize he was flirting or too surprised in the moment to say any good flirting lines back. But a customer asked me for my number one day, and I gave it to him. I guess I kind of wanted to motivate my crush to ask me out, but literally the week after, he went out with his sister's friend (the sister set them up), but they broke up and he likes me.

Whenever I’m having a conversation with strangers, I’m often pretty quiet and I don’t know what to say (unless it’s work related or something I’m really familiar with). I think this is normal with society anxiety though

But whenever I have conversations with a group of people I’m comfortable with, like my family, I feel like I suck at having conversations. If it’s about a topic I don’t care about, I always zone out or stare at out the window. If it’s about a topic I’m interested in, it’s so hard to wait my turn to talk. I feel so impatient to wait my turn (I can wait but it stresses me out and it’s hard to jump in sometimes). It feels like I’m going to forget what I was going to say or they’ll change the topic before I can talk. And then when I talk, I feel like people don’t really care about what I have to say. My family always talks over me or focus on what the person said before me. They never remember what I say either in the future compared to what my siblings say. It feels like a chore to have conversations, sometimes it’s just easier to stay quiet and fade into the background.

These factors will undoubtedly result in job exhaustion and possible resignation due to excessive stress.

Before it I never experienced anxiety like I do now, but somehow it came on painfully out of no where. Panic attacks more than once a day, unable to control my thoughts, horrible intrusive thoughts, nightmares, insomnia, constant fidgeting &amp; some anger/irritability for no reason at all. 
After a month or two from healing from Covid (Covid long haul) I was getting better, no more panic attacks, able to drive, get out and be happy. I was okay, till now. One night I woke up a little too early so I decided to stay up instead of falling back asleep for three or so hours, and boom it was back.

I live with my fiance, but he's had health struggles this year, as well as difficulties at work, so he has leaned on me daily, breaking down and panicking before work, calling me for 30-90 minutes a few times a week while I'm at work, breaking down when he gets home from work...after about 20 minutes each time I get overwhelmed and frustrated, but I signal anger. Then he says he feels like he has no support, so I feel like my efforts are wasted.

I have my own problems. But I shove them down and go to work, clean the house, make dinner, basically do the things that need to be done every day. I shoulder the mental load in our household.

My blood pressure has spiked the past few months. I've had a rash on my face for 2 months. I see doctors weekly for migraines and chronic back pain. My parents don't call me, my 2 closest friends both underwent cancer treatments this year, and my fiance is overwhelmed. I work from home, so my fiance is the only person I see each day. 

I feel so alone with my own problems.

Yeah, withdrawals and discontinuation syndromes suck. But discouraging people from taking medication X that his doc prescribed now he's scared to take it is immoral.

You had this experience, fine, doesn't mean he will. I saw a post on someone taking clonazepam for years on 6 mgs a day.

He stupidly cold-turkey'd one day and even months later he had no withdrawals. Other's might have lethal seizures.

It's very annoying to see a question about medication X and then tons of comments practically tell him not to take it because of withdrawals. 

Withdrawals are normal, so are discontinuation syndromes. You must go through it for 1 - 2 weeks, yes, very uncomfortable. I also suffered it. But this is not a reason to discourage someone to take the medication he was prescribed for his illness.

Not to mention, he is not you. He/She might not experience the same things you did.

I’m not proud of this behavior. I recently started therapy for my overall anxiety. Unfortunately it is hard to afford to have sessions often enough. 

Context: 
He lied 1.5 years ago about something relating to a female coworker it was not infidelity. After lying, he was able to “prove” he was telling the truth. I feel 99% confident about it. Since then, he lied about about small things like not playing video games while on the phone. Idk I don’t want to damage my relationship with this but I also don’t want to be lied to again and turn a blind eye.

My ex and I broke up almost 7 years ago. It was a horribly messy and terrible break up that caused me to be suicidal (we both made mistakes). There was never any closure and it always felt like it should have ended differently. It often felt like she felt the same as well...at least back then (think she might resent me now).

Been having some real down moments lately and I've been thinking about my ex a lot. I'm still attached to those days and emotionally often feel stuck there. There's still a giant piece of me that belongs to her.

I've been in a fairly healthy relationship for the past 5 years but I have quite a few things I lied about in the early parts of our relationship. I feel like it's so unfair to her.

I couldn’t even look at her or I’d just start shaking worse.

* Spice and wolf

* Girl's last tour

* Serial Experiments Lain

They are not really related in any genre way but all feature some sort of disconnect with the MCs and the rest of the world. It's like you're just traveling through it and never really putting down roots but instead just observing for a while and then moving on, they all sort of have this somber undertone that you're not really a part of the world and just experiencing small parts of it. 

Most of them feature a pair traveling together which makes it feel less lonely but Mushishi only has the MC and that's the one that feels closest to AvPD in a weird way in my mind.

6014,"Since December I had a complete breakdown in December, nearly a month to the day after writing my mom out of my life.  I am mid 30s, and my therapist said I have two ptsd triggers from childhood trauma, with my mother being the largest chunk.

The ER trip in December involved barking ""Help"" but feeling like I wasn't the one saying it, and randomly losing consciousness due to hyperventilating, and intense heart palpitations.

The heart palpitations and hyperventilating happened about 7 years ago as well, and I remember doing similar when I was a young kid.

I had another panic attack last week, and my anxiety has been up and down.  Hydroxyzine for panic instances, and prozac to keep me level.

My mind instantly goes to the worst places when my anxiety is high:  it's a stroke, a heart attack, a tumor, an uncurable/unknown disease.

Thanks to therapy, I'm no longer depersonalizing/derealizing, but this just means that staying in the moment involves powering through intense heart palpitations, fear, and cold/hot feelings.

The medication brought back a handful of dreams for the first time in more than a decade or two, but only for a week.  But now, I have had a handful of ""simple"" auditory hallucinations, such as a drum beat, a beeping sound, or the sound of water pouring, all of which are coming from in my head.

Has anyone had a similar mental breakdown after removing someone like a parent?  Work has been a stressor too, but my mom was the trigger, and work was the icing.  For months before this, I was frequently tired and not hungry at all, and always stressed at work, and had a short temper.

I just want to feel normal.  Right now, things are generally ok, but when that spiraling anxiety occurs, it's really hard to break free and feel like I'm staying sane.",4

I don't think I could face them when I get so bad that I can't even get out of bed, they shouldn't have to deal with me. I wouldn't want them to look at me differently. I don't even talk to my friends about how depression gets me feeling, because I'm afraid they'll see me differently too. They don't deserve to have to listen to me drone on.

It’s common knowledge that it’s hard at the moment and will take a lot longer than usual. I am dealing with a lot of backlog and it seems to just keep building every day. I do get some help sometimes it I think I’ll have to speak to a manager about getting some more. I’ve also got to keep on top of it and make decisions on what I will take out which day which is stressing me out. I won’t be able to do it all in a day so I will have to deliver different sections on a rotational basis.

It's been that way since I was a kid.My parents were afraid I'd be a hoarder. When I moved back home, I hired a cleaning lady for my parents house because I didn't want to argue with them about my bedroom after coming home from work. It was AMAZING. When I moved out I didn't have the budget for her to come to my apartment. The first year couple of years I did great, but then I started grad school during the pandemic. I got overwhelmed quickly. I had enough in my budget to hire her and it's kept me healthy! She comes every 2 weeks. That motivates me to do laundry and throw away trash so it's not in her way.

Almost got into having my own room but it fell apart before that. 

This is pretty much crazy but hopefully it will work out. I’m on disability so I’m trying to live somewhere I can get a cheap apartment. It’s possible I can get a job to make the budget issues easier. For living in unhealthy situations I couldn’t hold down a job. I’m at least hoping that’s the reason.

6041,"Adequate protein intake My last post was removed for being pseudo-science. Fair enough. Here are a few sources that recommend eating at least 1g protein per kg of bodyweight:

https://neurosciencenews.com/high-protein-diet-depression-22760/

""A new study that focused on nutrition and mental health of adolescent athletes found an association between high protein consumption and a decrease in symptoms of depression.""

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19841581/

""The indicator amino acid oxidation-based requirement values of 0.93 and 1.2 g protein/kg/day and the reanalysis of existing nitrogen balance studies are significantly higher than current recommendations. Therefore, there is an urgent need to reassess recommendations for protein intake in adult humans.""

https://examine.com/guides/protein-intake/#references

""higher protein intakes increase satiety, which is particularly helpful if you’re trying to cut calories as part of a weight-loss diet""


https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/how-much-protein-do-you-need-every-day-201506188096

""The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for protein is a modest 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. The RDA is the amount of a nutrient you need to meet your basic nutritional requirements. In a sense, it’s the minimum amount you need to keep from getting sick — not the specific amount you are supposed to eat every day.""

As you can see, making sure you eat enough protein improves depression symptoms, helps weight loss (but is not a panacea) which we struggle with, and is generally deemed to be safe. 

The mainstay advice is *at least* 0.8g protein per kg bodyweight. It is generally recommended to get this protein from plant sources and also engage in physical activity.",2

6043,"An absence of social pleasure (social anhedonia) It is not possible to know what it is like to experience the world from inside someone else’s body, but I can infer from others that people enjoy being with other people more than I do. 

It is rare that I enjoy a person’s company. Usually I look forward to being alone again. Instead of pleasure, I do feel an absence of loneliness or fear, but these are not pleasure. I very much experience health benefits from being with other people, I can’t deny this, but in the moment I feel like something important is missing. 

To say it different, I don’t feel a desire to be with others unless I am wanting to soothe or avoid loneliness or fear. By default, being alone is peaceful and ideal. 


Is it really anhedonia, or is it also possible that my default is actually that the social anxiety overpowers the social pleasure so that I can’t feel feel. And it takes a really strong negative emotion to overpower social anxiety in order to provoke a desire to be with others.

I even asked him to order a take home monitor for me just for some peace of mind and he was ok with that. I had an echocardiogram done about 1 year ago with a different cardiologist and everything came back great. Now as I get home from the doctor my anxious brain gets to plotting and is now worrying that ""He didn't order you another echocardiogram what if he's missing something"". My rational brain believes and trusts this doctor very much, but the anxiety part of my brain just wants to create more worry for any reason it can find. Can anyone give me some advice or insight? Is there even any Medical reason I would need a second echocardiogram 1 year later? I assume it detects defects that have been there probably from birth so a second one is probably pointless but it's hard to tell my anxious brain that.

I’ve been fine for a while, surprisingly, considering I’ve been off my meds for a while. But yesterday was rough. I was starting to feel depressed and numb again so I did everything I could to keep it at bay. I went out, I tried to do hobbies, spend some time outside. But then my anxiety and paranoia started setting in. I feel like I was being watched and veery sound the woods made freaked me out. Eventually I couldn’t stand it anymore and had to go inside and go to bed. 

Something to note, I’ve been off my meds but just recently realized I was a fucking idiot and am moving back onto them. For context of the next day, I took some hydroxyzine last night to help me calm down and sleep. I tend to wake up a bit groggy but it fades. 

But today i’ve felt horrible. I’ve been depressed, irritable, paranoid, I just don’t want to be here anymore dealing with it. 
I have a dog and because of our house set up, I have to spend all day in the dining room with dining chairs and tile floor. No where to lay down. So I laid on the floor. Earlier I had been throwing a toy for my dog but stopped because my energy felt so low. 

As I was lying there, she kept nipping at my heels and barking when I told her to stop. Finally, my anger boiled over and I yelled at her. I said awful things to her that I don’t want to repeat, even to strangers on the internet. I put her in her crate and went to the bathroom to take a bath and calm down.

6078,"So tired of being the person laughed at and not taken seriously. I'm a bit of an introvert but through the years I learned to appear social and outgoing with people. In most contexts it's positive and useful. But in others things turn out terribly for an actually shy and introvert person. 

I sometimes make jokes about memes, funny videos, etc. It's a good way to engage with other people at work for example. Rest of the people do the same. It's not that I'm joking more than the rest of the people. 

I never make jokes about the others, I'm very respectful. I even avoid any joke or meme that might be hurtful to other people. 

Yet there's always a moment where people go from laughing with me to laughing at me. For example, now people at work make fun about my poor diet. I never detailed anything about what I eat, or if I had time to cook. And some of those people bring canned food. Or about some of my habits. When stuff like this starts happening, I feel really hurt. It's like I thought for a long time I was sharing funny moments with workmates, and actually everybody was clowning me. 

There are some ridiculous things about me. My voice is high pitched and soft for a man my age (37) and that would be a main thing. I'm gay and that makes it even more obvious, but I don't talk about my sexuality since it's private. 

I wonder if these aspects make me the target of getting laughed at when actually I'm being friendly like the others. 

However I no longer care. Once I get fed up with all this, I avoid any unnecessary socialization with people who hurt me. I would consider to say what I wrote here in a polite way, but it's impossible to do that without being looked like a dramatic person. 

 So I've decided to not eat again with this people, just go outside or stay on my own. Not the first time it happens to me, but the first where i can just avoid it easily.

6084,"Post greif depression I've  dealt with depression too many times in my life but this episode feels different.
I've been depressed after losing the love of my life in a car crash about two months ago and I still find it so hard to leave the bed.
I left the house twice during this time just for emmergency and that was it.
I've been staying with my parents, I've cut every contact with my friends and I isolated myself .
Now I feel so anxious and stressed about going back to my life again, to friends, my work, my house . Everything is overwhelming and scary. It's like I can't do it on my own. And it makes me feel so pathetic.
Every one have been judging me so poorly and I feel so guilty about it.
They're like ""oh girl get over it"". 
""He's in a better place""
""Are you still hanging up on him"" 
""Come on, look at your life""
All that kinda of stuff
Anyway how would I get out this vicious cycle? How would I get myself out of the house? And talking to people again?
Any tips please",1

Some days I want to die but then the next I try improve and feel better but it’s a constant cycle, I get more exhausted every time I have to pull myself away from these feelings.

I used to have some self esteem and socialise and build relationships, now I struggle to connect to people now and just feel awkward. I often analyse social situations and just feel regret.

6125,"How to tell the difference between mental disorders and shit life syndrome? I've been trying to answer this question for a while. How do I know what's the cause and what's the effect when it comes to mental state? Am I depressed and suicidal because of how my life turned out to be or am I perceiving life to be more shitty than it is because of underlying mental disorders?  

I have never been to a psychiatrist so I have never been diagnosed, but I've been dealing with OCD since I was 6, I experience a lot of MDD, anxiety, social phobia and ADHD symptoms. I've also been suicidal for more than 6 years at this point. The thing is, most of those things appear so small when put next to 7 figures in the bank account. Most of my issues would immediately disappear. Only then I would be able to do things because I can, not because I have to. I experience what I'd call a ""money induced paralysis"". I talk a bit more explicitly about it in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/v4qq6k/discussion_lack_of_motivation_induced_by_lack_of/) thread.  

It's very unlikely that I'll ever be financially independent and it's unlikely I'll ever find something interesting enough I'd deem worth pursuing for hours on end(AKA passion). Those realizations alone are enough to make me apathetic, procrastinate on all matters and basically give up on life and wait for the right opportunity to kill myself. I'd rather be dead than live a life I don't consider to be worth the effort.  

I've been thinking about seeing a psychiatrist for the past few months but I have my doubts. I procrastinate on making an appointment because it feels like my problems stem from money, it's not like they'll make me rich over there. In fact I'll lose money. That is enough justification for me not to go. I also can't get myself to schedule other appointments (blood tests, physio, dentist) because if my life will remain the same despite improving in some areas, then why bother? I'll kill myself anyway without winning a lottery or without some magical epiphany occurring in my mind.  

I suspect there could be something wrong with my brain, because plenty of other people have lives objectively worse than me, yet they see survival as something of value in and of itself. That could be the result of them being ignorant, me being ungrateful or my brain being disabled. So, how do I know whether my shitty mental state is caused by my views on life, philosophy, bad attitude, being lazy, ungrateful, spoiled, etc. or by some condition beyond my reach? Or perhaps that's how it's supposed to be, because my conclusions are logical and I just can't ignore them?",4

6170,"My appearance is making me severely depressed I've already been in therapy for 3 years and its not helping. I hate the way I look, I hate my face, my body, and everything else about myself. My therapist and family constantly lie to me by telling me I'm pretty and look normal but I know that im objectively repulsive. I've been consistently rated very below average by people online. Even IRL I have never been in a relationship or on a date ever. I feel ashamed to exist in public spaces, nobody should be forced to look at me. No amount of makeup or exercise can fix or help me. There's no fixing bone structure unless I were to suddenly become very rich. I don't know what to do anymore, Im too scared to commit suicide but I don't want to continue living in this body while feeling guilty for existing. Anyone that says ""looks dont matter"" is already attractive or average looking. I don't know how to cope with all this.",1

Life just feels so unfair sometimes. Like I’m having to work twice as hard as other people in my life and I’m just drowning.

6187,"Are we neurodivergent? I was reading the post about crapping on coping mechanisms that was posted recently and I was surprised to hear that many people consider themselves neurodivergent because of their bipolar. 

Please inform me if I sound really ignorant! 

I was under the impression that neurodivergence is an innate difference in thinking, permeating everything you do and the brain is inherently wired differently. This is most often associated with ADHD and Autism spectrum disorders. 

I personally feel that although I have a mental illness, that when well controlled and stable I am “wired” the same as most people. My therapist described an allegory that stuck for me which was “Your personality is the climate, and your mood is the weather”. 

I think that my climate is “neurotypical” and I do not identify myself as neurodivergent, more as someone who deals with periods of mental illness.

I knew that from the beginning but hoping to please and attempt to make her proud of my accomplishments she would just say ""Why do I need to say I'm proud of you? You have to be proud of yourself""  It's been an ongoing toxic loop so I always distance myself or not contact her, however since last week she's been living with me and we have been bickering here and there. I don't let that get in the way with work though.


Anyway. Today this random stranger during my break time came up to me and looked directly into my eyes and said

 ""You don't need to push yourself. It's okay.""

She kept holding my shoulders and gently rubbing them and I have no clue if this is hypnosis

 ""I know you have some family troubles right now but I can see there are good people behind you. Really good people""

And little by little the weight in my shoulders started to get lighter. And it felt fuzzy. I had this feeling why does she know my family? Can she read me? Am I readable? Is my aura out? I'm about to panic! Then I just burst into tears and had to control myself to do the next reporting.

It was such a confusing experience because she was smiley nice in her 50s lady. 

Can someone tell me if she was a hypnotist or if she can see my soul or some angels or if she was just an empath that knew I was extremely stressed and wanted to let me know I was stressed. Because later She was motioning to her friend her shoulders like letting her know my shoulders were super tight or scrunched up.

I think this whole thing started when I was around 5. I was at the store with my parents and I wanted to buy a toy, but my mom said something about how we didn’t have the money for toys. I, being the stupid kid that I was, interpreted this as “we don’t have a lot of money” and that the family was one bad financial decision away from poverty.

I was debating asking for weeks, me and my parents have had a strained relationship in the past to say the least, some definitely their fault, some a mix of both of our faults. Anyway, it's left a gap between us that I haven't been brave enough to cross.

But last night I asked them, told them I wasn't struggling with the current allowance it would purely be for an extra nice thing a week to help me get by during these times. IMO they've blown it way out of proportion, they wanted a phone call today to log all my spending and now they're wanting to come and visit me TODAY.

as a result of this, I learned a lot about medication. not even really on purpose, learning about the meds people are on is just an inevitable of being in a group like this.

my psyche prescribed me abilify today, and out of curiosity I asked if that was the med known to sometimes lead to tardive dyskinesia. I'm not against trying abilify, all meds can have horrible side effects, but I wanted to know if that's what I was potentially getting myself into.

This went on for multiple years and stopped at some point (as far as I know, Idk if I have just gitten blind to it) it was not too long after all of it that she started saying that she could not remember any of it, this has gotten to a point that I even started questioning my own memory of my childhood. I often find myself questioning if I remember something right just because of this and I can't really get myself to trust her 100% even getting scared of her sometimes that she might do something to me.

I also remember wanting to jump out the window at like age 10, the intend was there but I think it was also to see if my mother cared. I ended up not doing it because her reaction was just nothing, I didn't expect her to just not care at all.

I also had a lot of pressure due to my grades being very bad, I at one point got even worse grades due to me trying to escape into my fantasy, that did go on for about 2 years, therapy could have helped but no one thought of that. My grades eventually got better and I graduated and am now at university.

I'm currently trying to get therapy and hopefully come to terms with everything in atleast some way.",1

I have manic episodes but they only last a couple days, then I go straight back into depression. When I am depressed I completely withdraw from society and go into my shell.

I've been laying here in bed for days, not bathing, and in this cycle of not doing the paperwork but then feeling guilty about it, and its fucking miserable. 

I know that avoiding the paperwork is only causing me to make the anxiety and problem worse, but even the thought of likely losing my job isn't enough to overcome the lack of motivation.

i was recently diagnosed. to sum up my dilemma, my entire life anytime i’ve had a medical problem arise, i’ve always been dismissed as it being “anxiety”. i have a history of unexplained syncope episodes &amp; wacky blood test results but no doctor has ever taken me seriously. perks of being a 22 year old female. i’ve been told to take antidepressants for viral illnesses &amp; the like. so i’ve grown costumed to having a distrust towards doctors or i feel like they just use me for money &amp; don’t listen to me, ya know?

anyway, that’s not why i’m here. i hit rock bottom a few months ago &amp; have been seeing a wonderful therapist who truly advocates for me &amp; gives me a voice. he referred me to a psychologist &amp; we did the whole genesight thing. she wants me to start taking latuda.

i did the whole googling the medicine thing &amp; asked some friends about it, &amp; i have yet to see a good review. i also don’t want to be even more tired than i am now as i’m exhausted 24/7 as is. &amp; im scared meds could impact work or school.

i guess i’m just here asking for validation to ease my anxiety. will meds actually help me? or will i feel miserable? i’m really scared. i’m so hyper aware of my body &amp; i freak out about any minor change, even headaches. but also as the months go on the more i feel wildly reckless &amp; isolated. if i start taking them, &amp; want to get off them, will they forever change me like antidepressants can? i’d rather enjoy my few months of mania no matter how wild it can be vs forever be different..

And I only got a sprinkle of highs. I know I shouldn't wish for more highs but the lows are so goddamn low, I just want to get at level 0. Hypomania is not a side dish in my plate : it's barely a spice.

6270,"Therapy or Attachment Therapy? 50-something gay man here. While I’ve been in therapy for most of my life, because I was always dealing with dysthymia / Persistent Depression, Attachment issues were never discovered or diagnosed. A year ago, TMS put my depression into remission, which has been amazing. Awesome. Endless superlatives.  However....

With PDD  no longer fouling the view, surprise-surprise, I see now that Dismissive-Avoidant Attachment has been playing merrily in my psyche, my attention having been elsewhere.

I've never had a “real” deep, intimate sexual relationship. (Sex yes.) Friends, yes, but again, none particularly deep. Distancing. Closed off. Difficulty trusting.  From what I can tell, DA has influenced, inhibited, even impaired a lot of areas of my life. I’d like to fix or improve those if I can. 

To be honest, I’m a bit concerned  -- read ""scared"" -- that I won’t be able to do that. DA is a hard one to move to Secure Attachment. From reading, it looks like it basically takes an intimate SA partner (and therapy) to change an attachment style. Since I haven't even had a crappy intimate relationship, that seems…unlikely. lol

I have therapist right now. We’ve talked a bit about this. He’s not an expert / certified in Attachment Therapy.  Cognitive Behavioral? Yes. General support, especially with the TMS stuff, yes. Given the seeming intractability of DA, I'm wondering if he's right for tackling this? I know DA is an error in cognition… but it’s also wrapped up in feelings and in behaviors that I’m not even aware of. Trauma. Family of origin stuff. There's a lot that goes into DA. And while I've tackled much of this in ""regular"" therapy, I've never come at it from an attachment angle, with someone who specialized in Attachment Theory and styles

So, in your opinion, is it better to have a therapist that specializes in Attachment Issues or is that not necessary? Will an Attachment group or class suffice? Is changing therapists reasonable here -- I'm up for doing that -- or is that idea someone  just another sign of  Avoidant / Dismissing behavior? 

While I ain’t dead and have no plans on dying anytime soon — or later, for that matter — I would like to *fix* this DA before I shuffle off. Along those lines, I’d like to stumble and fail at a *real* relationship or two -- I know DA is hard to lessen --  on the off chance that I just  succeed at one. I want to improve my life. I’m just trying to figure out the best way to go at it. 

Any advice here would be great.",3

6278,"Health Anxiety This past few months I’ve had a set of symptoms that have had me worried that I have a neurological disorder. I am wondering if these symptoms could be caused by stress, and if anyone here has had similar symptoms they know to be caused by stress.

A little context, I recently got accepted into my dream job. The only hitch is that it has intense training for six months, where if you fail a test at any point you are dismissed. The material we are required to study is immense in volume and the tests are close to twice a week.

In the month leading up to the course I found myself experiencing a small head fog. It developed more and more over the weeks into the worst head fog of my life. I could barely think and always felt a sort of pressure in my head. Math I would normally fly through was difficult and even just simple thoughts were hard to get out sometimes. As the course started my vision started to feel off, not quite sure if it was/is double or blurry as it’s not that bad, but I can tell it’s off. My eyes also got super sore for a week or so. About a week ago I also started to feel my left jaw and arm go a bit numb/tingly. It’s mostly there but comes and goes in intensity. 

Since the head fog I have been chronically online in search of answers which has lead me down every rabbit hole. I am frightened i have something like MS, and though I know my research into it along with my stress with my course is more likely to blame, I can’t help but doubt that stress alone could give me blurry vision, numb arm/face, and immense brain fog

I would really appreciate anyone’s experience with stress, ms, or related symptoms.

Side note, very very far fetched side note, a thought that I’ve had is maybe, just maybe, ADHD is causing my anxiety? And this is why these medications aren’t working? I’ve read adhd can cause anxiety disorders. 
Ugh I just want to know what the hell is wrong with me and how to fix it.",4
6286,"Diagnosed a week ago I got diagnosed a week ago, as Bipolar Type 2. I've talked with my psychiatrist and my therapist a ton about the diagnosis, and it's definitely really interesting to see the way so many Bipolar symptoms align with my behaviors so well, and really explain my struggles.

I don't know about everyone here, but I feel like my diagnosis has just felt so confusing. I feel happy that I finally have a diagnosis that feels accurate (I've been trying to figure out a diagnosis for about a year). I'm taking medication that I'm excited about, I feel really happy that my psychiatrist and therapist both think this diagnosis is 100% accurate.

I just also feel so lost - like a part of me has been identified that has been ignored for so long. It's really strange to feel like no one has ever really questioned my behavior. I feel a little odd even just identifying with the Bipolar label, I feel like maybe I've made up my symptoms in my head.

I guess just looking to see how other people felt after their diagnoses, and whether or not this kind of odd confused feeling goes away.",2
6287,"rejection this is kind of a stupid, petty thing to talk about but honestly, i just wanna get this off my chest. 

i have a friend, we've been friends for like, 5 years already and we've basically grown up together. we were both sort of socially withdrawn so all we had were one another, and so we'd talk everyday, all day. 

i remember this one time we had a conversation where they told me that they tend to ghost people and slowly pull back when they feel as if talking to someone starts to feel draining, or they just don't like the person anymore. 

lately, they've been pulling away, like replying less and less, and just ignoring me for the entire day. though, sometimes they'd stay and have a full conversation with me, but it's kind of rare and i get the feeling that they do it only to ""keep me there"", like to ensure my stay... kind of like a push and pull. 

it's not like they don't have time either. sometimes when we'd have a half conversation, they'd always, and i say always, talk about how they're connecting with someone, how they had fun with someone new, all this passionate stuff, and it just stings a bit. by a bit, i mean a lot. i know i'm not entitled to their time by any means but like, i just feel like i've been hit by a truck. i know they're purposely ignoring me, i know they're losing interest in me, i even get the feeling that we're growing out of one another. 

i'm just wondering... what about me isn't enough that's worthy of their time? am i not interesting enough? am i boring? i don't know. oh well, shit happens i suppose. i'm trying to fight the urge to isolate myself for half a year because i keep feeling rejected by them.",3
6288,"to PHP or not to PHP I went through a hypomanic/ mixed episode for the past two and a half weeks that came to a head on Wednesday, resulting in SI. I’m no longer experiencing the SI and had a med change, but was asked if I’d be open to a PHP. Today I received the intake phone call, and they want me to start next Wednesday. 
If my existence within the bipolar lens is continuously cycling and from stable to unstable—if I’m no longer experiencing the SI do I still participate in the PHP? I don’t currently have any providers other than my psychiatrist, which is definitely an issue. I’m also worried about taking the time off work because I have a big project due soon and my colleague is out. 
All in all, it’s only 5-7 days so do I do the one thing I have been putting off for years because of school and career, or do I put myself first and participate? Is it worth the time, effort, and disappointment of my boss, knowing that I’m going to cycle for the rest of my life?",2

* Biggest one right now are doctors, medical.  Get really anxious, blood pressure and BPM go up.

* It is hit or miss, but if I have a presentation or in front of people, get real nervous.  Remember bombing for one performance where I just stood there... one time.
* Get nervous around attractive people for some reason.  Yea.

6296,"Is this a psychological condition? Or just inability to deal with stress? Hi, I don't know if it's the right place to post this but lately I have been figuring out the features of a life-long problem of mine. I would call it the simple inability to manage stress but I want to be more specific and Im curious if other people can feel the same based on how I describe it. I would describe the relation between me and stress in this way:

\- The incapacity to accept stress and everyday fatigue as a normal part of life (referred also to very simple tasks)

\- The forced splitting between ""bad days"" and ""good days"" where in the bad days Im not allowed to feel good because of some stressful tasks to do that basically ruin the whole day, while in the good days Im not allowed to feel stressed because ""Im not supposed to feel so"" and Im not meant to do some extra stuff that would cause some fatigue. It also ends up in hating the ending of a ""good day"" becuase tomorrow is gonna be a ""bad day""... You know when sunday is ending and monday is the next day, or also when you're coming back from a vacation, Basically the inability of enjoying the moment because my mind is always projected in the future.

\- Rejection of the idea of facing new stressful situations: this becomes particulary strong whenever I just came through some stressful stuff, my mind sells to me a higher level of stress tolerance/performance in a particular moment, with the promise that Im not going to face new similar situations in the future... I use to motivate myself during difficult moments with the thought that afler that everything is over, Im going to rest and it's gonna be a good time. But this also tricks my mind into thinking that there are not going to be similar stressful situations in the future overall, which obviously can't be true.

\- The high expectation before a supposed ""good day"" or ""good time"" is about to come... as if it's going to be a super regenerating moment for me that will restore all my power of will. This is not rational and not realistic most of the times because everyone would never get enough of a ""good time"" and unpleasant things can happen during a planned good time as well.

\- Feeling envious towards people who are not going through a stressful moment while I am. Focusing almost in an obsessive way on other people around me who are chilled and are not facing anything difficult. In those moments I forget that everyone has stressful moments just not at the same time, I am the free person when other are facing hard moments.

\- the excessive anxiety and discomfort before a task that I know its' going to be stressful... also an easy one. As if my mind was trying to convince me that Im never supposed to be stressed and that's not normal for me doing stuff that I don't like even if they're necessary.",0

I don't really understand why, especially since they weren't things I even brought up often unless asked, never delved into unless asked.

My next appointment for my psychiatrist isn’t for another 3 weeks (she’s also very booked out) but I will be talking to her about what I’m saying here :) 

My psych started me on 10mg of Abilify. I started taking it and felt so jittery and just down right awful. I couldn’t stand up in the shower, I couldn’t do my makeup or get dressed. I also didn’t feel like it would be safe for me to drive. It was hell.  

I took 10mg for 5 days. I went to the chemist that we see very regularly to pick up our prescriptions and she said I am experiencing akathisia. Her advice was to write it down and see if it gets any worse, and if it did, to email my psychiatrist or get into contact with her some way. 

I kind of took it my own way and just started taking half of the pills, and guess what? Akathisia is only half as bad now. 
I’ve been taking the half tablets for maybe 5 days? So 9 days on Abilify so far. It’s still horrible but I’d never want to feel that way again. It was so bad. 

I know Abilify is not the right medication for me. The benefits for me are : less racing thoughts, more stable mood. 

The disadvantages of Abilify for me are: not helping sleep at all (this has been a huge issue for years), feeling kinda “weird” and not myself around my friends etc. losing interest in a lot of creative things I used to love. And of course, the akathisia. 

I am scared of a few “bipolar meds” because I’m scared of gaining weight now that I am at a healthy weight. Just thought I’d add that in there. 

This is kind of a vent, and I know finding the perfect or best combination of medication isn’t easy and takes time but I’d love to hear everyone’s experiences with different medications :)",2

I regularly fantasise about still hanging out with old friends I haven't spoken to in over a decade, making up memories that never happened just trying to forget that are not part of my life anymore. 

The only times I've ever been truly happy was just being ""one of the guys"" where I was invited to things and people liked having me around for some reason I couldn't quite understand.

6350,"You own it Possible controversial post here but I speak from my own experience. I've finally come out of the depths of the darkest, longest depression I've experienced. It took perseverance, self advocacy, accountability, and surrendering when it was too difficult to cope. Oh, and tons of therapy. 

From all of this I've learned that I own my own happiness. No one else is responsible for it because they've got their own to worry about. It's my body and I also own the right to know what works best for it. Meds, eating the foods that make me feel my best, moving my body, journaling my thoughts. All these steps pay off. 

It. Just. Takes. Time. I'm the world's most impatient person and the universe is always teaching my ways I need to slow down and smell the roses. Enjoy the simple things and little moments. All these things add up. 

You all can do this for yourselves and more. Keep up the good fight!",2

Hi all, I’m really sorry if this post triggers anybody, please don’t read if you’re prone to being triggered by content relating to depression/despair. 

With that in mind, how the fuck am I supposed to be excited about living the rest of my life? I’m only 23 years old, and I’m so goddamn tired. The older I get, the more acutely aware I get of just how wrong my brain is. I try so hard, and it can’t be fixed? As we all know. I’m on medication, but in a few months I’ll be off my moms insurance and I CANNOT afford private insurance. I know everyone says we NEED to be on meds, and I agree. I need to be on meds. But staring down the barrel right now, I know I cannot and will not be able to just a while from now. And I hate this fucking disorder so much, because all it does is lie to you. I can’t trust my happiness or my sadness or my apathy. I am genuinely so exhausted of managing these feelings, and it gets worse every year as I get more and more compounded “adult” stress. How am I supposed to want to go on like this? And no I am not at risk of ending my life, I have too much guilt and shame to think of doing that to my family, but that just compounds the pain of existing for no reason beyond obligation. How do you all do it? Why do you all do it? Literally any input or advise or comment is appreciated to help me feel maybe just a little less alone, sorry for being so whiny.",2

If she and I can agree the man she married is horrible, then she should be able to look in the mirror and recognize what she sees too, but no, coz she's ""better than him"". 

I'm only ever patient with her and when she happens to see what i did isn't to perfection, I'm just degraded in the angriest and loudest manner possible and reminded for how i keep making mistakes. Then there's my dad who is an emotionally and verbally abusive misogynistic narcissist whom i just tolerate because anytime i say something I'm deemed too young to know anything or too serious.

Even though I silenty seeth with anger everytime they put me down, everytime that anger and resentment fades away, I still go back to craving the love I want from them and loving them the ways I know I can that they will accept.

6356,"I got a stern reminder that being stable doesn’t mean I am cured I recently had to lower my lithium (under doctor supervision) because my lithium level was too high. I started to notice that I felt less numb. I felt butterflies in my stomach and a warm, fuzzy happy for the first time since I was a teenager. It was intoxicating. So I thought to myself, maybe I don’t need my lithium anymore. I never tried stopping it completely after ECT. This was a bad plan…

For the last few days I felt something I hadn’t felt in a long time too. The overwhelming depression, self hatred and urge to harm myself. It was terrifying. And I found I was completely out of practice in suppressing those feelings. 

Back on my lithium… I am the first one to advocate taking your pills so I feel like a hypocrite. I have been reminded that deep in my mind bipolar is still there and still capable of destroying me. It was humbling, terrifying and discouraging all at the same time. Today I mourn the fact that I will never be able to fully feel emotions and will always have to be “sedated” to some degree. I shouldn’t complain because at least I have stability. But that taste of what life is really supposed to feel like and knowing I will never have it has left me in a bad way. I feel ungrateful for the stability I have and greedy for the way I used to feel before getting sick. I feel here is the only place where people will understand what I’m going through. - sincerely a very tired bipolar warrior",2

When are brains are overloaded with stress hormones it goes berserk. As I've learned to accept my symptoms as a part of my anxiety &amp; not fight or repress them, it's alot easier to manage.""Anxiety will not kill me"" is my mantra.

Being ugly has made me feel like a FUCKING ROBOT. I’m sooo fucking jealous of everyone everywhere. Everyone at my job has these personalities that they just express without thinking of how the other person will perceive them. They crack lame jokes witty jokes and everyone laughs and accepts it and they all act like they’re brothers and sisters. Of course I’m the fucking outcast who is quiet all the time and doesn’t say anything but robotic one liners…. BECAUSE I FEEK LIKE THATS ALL I CAN DO. Anytime I’ve tried being funny and more comfortable I got shot down so many times. People would say “who tf says that” “shut up” or just flat out ignore me opposed to how they laugh with each other and and add on to each other’s jokes

I feel like I have to constantly watch what I say every fucking time I’m talking to anyone. People have said “kobes weird hes too quiet hes a loner” but like I’m only quiet cause I feel like people will consider me lame and annoying if I try expressing myself and talking to them… it’s not fair no one else has these fears and I’m essentially trapped in my brain locked out from making any meaningful connections 

The worst part is I don’t even think this is fixable. It’s been this way for basically my whole life. Like whenever I tried to take a leap and express myself I’ve mostly been shot down and looked at like I was special needs and it’s dehumanizing and isolating I don’t know what tf to do. I’m so sick of being cursed to ugliness and this sub I just want to live my fucking life and connect with people

I feel like when YOURE ugly you’re not allowed to really express yourself and joke like everyone else because people will automatically take offense to it

6365,"Time for my checkup. Very anxious after I had a cancer scare last check up. Tips? Trigger warning: talk of cancer 

I’m 30f and I like to think I’ve somewhat defeated my anxiety. I used to have awful panic attacks daily and I’ve been panic attack free for months, I can’t remember my last one. 

But as my checkup approaches my anxiety is starting to return and im noticing my techniques are working less and less. 

My last check up in October seemed totally fine, then I got a call 2 weeks later saying something wasn’t right and it might be cancer. After 6 weeks of waiting and biopsies, it wasn’t cancer, but was the most advanced stage of precancer. I had surgery and got the “all clear for now.” I will have to be checked every 6 months for 3 years. 

I got a call to remind me that I need to come in soon and I’m just sort of freaking out. Knowing I’ll be waiting around for 2 weeks just expecting to see that number pop up and tell me it’s back or it’s cancer this time. 

Any advice for when your anxiety is around something very real, but also probably not likely (my doctor thinks it won’t come back and that I’ll be ok).",4
6366,"every strange thing that’s happened in the last 24 hours. please read . 14M. As a bit of background, I am currently in therapy for anxiety , depression OCD and for the last six weeks i have been on 50mg of sertraline a day and 2 lots of 20mg promethazine a day. 

since yesterday morning, i haven’t felt great but i atleast thought that the medication was working . was feeling depressed a bit the night before but something was drastically different.

I woke up and felt like i was incoherent but i wasn’t and began to feel very depressed. i put it down to just a bad day and i read online sertraline can cause depressive feelings . i continued on with my day not worrying until the nighttime . 

just before i was going to get into bed ,something didn’t feel right. i started to feel strange in ways i can’t describe and I had these 1 second headaches in the same spot every 5-10 minutes . my memory then began to feel weird and i checked my blood pressure which was normal. 

I then grabbed my playstation controller and headset and put it by my bedside which i never do . i always leave it on my desk. this freaked me out , but then again that could just be down to tiredness .

I got into bed and checked by blood pressure again. all normal. but something didn’t feel right at all. it felt like i was living in yesterday and then i suddenly got this strange feeling and this is the best way of describing it: it felt like I wasn’t conscious but i was at the same time . like to recall my memory it feels like none of that happened except it did . the world felt deaf and it felt like time was no longer linear . i felt as if i couldn’t process things properly, if at all. and thought brain bleed.

I then went to the bathroom and felt panicked but didn’t show it . I checked my pupils and they were fine . i then went back to my bedroom and began to text people ok reddit for advice and said it all sounds like anxiety. 

at this point my brain was telling me that I was forgetting something but i don’t know what, because that’s the whole point of forgetting something . I began to feel like I was in a delirious state and i felt as if i couldn’t hang on to a thought process.

 I was worried as this was not normal for me so i woke up my dad and told him what was happening . at this point when I was trying to read something i searched up on google , the words looked jumbled and i had to read it again. this has never been an issue before and i certainly don’t have dyslexia , so this made me worry .

I explained to my dad that the way I was feeling was not normal, so i asked him if I could call 111 (urgent care number) . I explained to them my situation and i was put on call later to a man who literally asked my father what he thought he should do if i was feeling delirious . at this point i realised it was pointless . he basically said it sounds like nothing physically but i disagreed. 

Exhausted of all my options , i decided to go to sleep. I got around 7 hours and slept straight through and had vivid detailed dreams .

I woke up around 11am after going to bed around 4am. I still had memory troubles but not nearly as bad as the night before . I tried to convince myself I was fine and realised i still felt strange and the letters looked a bit jumbled still. I’ve tried to brush it off all day but still feeling weird. a recent feeling in the past 6-7 hours i’ve attained is the feeling like i’m waking up and suddenly realising i’m doing something while i’m doing it subconsciously . but if i backtrack and i try to remember it all feels fine. just not in the moment. this is the thing that is freaking me out . 

any advice please ? any at all? does this sound like a brain bleed /mental confusion/delirium? or could this be explained by anxiety / derealization /tiredness? so scared honestly don’t know what to do.",4

6373,"I came off as an asshole today and I’m struggling with it I went to the mall to buy some fragrances and I came off as a massive asshole to the cashiers. There was originally only one girl that was attending the area I went to, so I thought I would be fine. Wrong. She seemed like she was new and when I asked her for the fragrance I wanted she seemed confused and said she was going to get someone to help me. She came back with two women, and they’re all staring at me while I say what I want. Then one of the women she brought back started asking me questions, I wasn’t prepared for this and I sort of shut down. She asked me what I was currently wearing and I lied and said I didn’t wear anything currently, then she asked me if I would wear something sweeter than the fragrance I had picked out and I just shook my head and looked at some other bottles of perfume. I acted mostly dismissive towards the three women because I was so uncomfortable and just wanted the situation to end. I wanted to get out of the situation as fast as possible so I grabbed a different fragrance that I was familiar with and told them I would just buy that. 

I had tried to prepare myself beforehand to speak to one person, because the last time I went there was only one person I had to talk to. Talking to three people made me so uncomfortable and I acted like a dismissive asshole. I thought it would be really easy for me since I already knew what I wanted and I assumed I could just tell the lady the name of what I wanted and she would tell me whether they had it or not. I also feel really bad for the new girl because I could tell she didn’t really know what she was doing and I just made it worse for her. And the lady that was asking me questions seemed very nice and I feel bad for acting the way I did. Now that I think about it, the second lady was probably trying to set an example to the new girl and I ruined it for her. 

I had avoided buying fragrances online in fear that the bottles would break in the mail but I will probably only buy them online from now on.

This experience made me realize that I also act cold and asshole-ish to everyone that’s not the people I live with, or my mom. But that’s also the only way I can speak to people, so I’m kind of stuck between don’t socialize at all or act cold to everyone.",3

I just got over a couple years of seriously shitty feeling depression that I didn’t talk to anyone about really. Therapist didn’t help, I was stressing my parents out too much, friends don’t like talking about serious topics.

6397,"Do you guys try to avoid people you know, or just people you don't know? I used to be anxious about being around strangers, but now I don't really care as much. But I always get way more anxious at the thought of meeting people I do know and I try to avoid them as much as I can.

I don't even see any value in forming friendships/relationships anymore. I try open up as little as possible to people. The more I get to know them, the more I try to avoid them.

I fear that friendships come with unrealistic expectations and that as people get to know me they'll realise that I'm weird and will gradually dislike me, and maybe try to make me feel guilty for not meeting their expectations. I also don't want to become dependent on other people, cos it seems like most 'friends' only seem to care about you when it suits them. I just think most friendships are fake and over-rated.",3

I feel stuck with a blocked brain that wouldn't get sleepy wouldn't get scared wouldn't do anything. Literally just blocked.

6424,"I feel like a nuisance I feel as if I am nothing more than a general nuisance to people. I say this because I had a falling out with someone that I once considered to be my best friend while we were both away at college last fall. I've known this young lady since high school, and I had a lot of trouble trying to make connections and new friends, and thus she was the only person I really had up there because I was so lonely. She felt that I wasn't giving her any space and that I was too intrusive, and as a result it feels like she wants nothing to do with me anymore. Sometimes, I question if she really wanted me around. I remember during her birthday last year, she had a bit of a celebration and I only found out because her then boyfriend posted it on Instagram. I felt left out. She said that she didn't want a large group and thus only invited people her parents didn't know, and planned on celebrating separately with people they already knew. When we did just that, she texted me two minutes before I was supposed to have her up that she was at a pizza party and would be running late. She did not show for another two hours. This past month, I've tried to reach out to her in an attempt to make amends, she barely responds to me. I asked if we could be able to talk in person, over face time or over the phone but I get no response. Because she seldom responds, I feel I have to start the conversation all over again. It's stressful, and it hurts my feelings.

Meanwhile, before I went up to college, I worked as a lunch monitor at one of my local elementary schools. This was immediately after I finished high school. While I loved working with the children, I had some problems there. Some of the kids were defiant, and very stubborn in their defiance. In the months before I went off to college, I tried to start a bowling club, but most of the kids would not even listen me and would just rough house and fool around. But the worst part was the treatment I was received from two separate staff members. During the 2020-21 school year, when I started working at the school, lunch was held in the classrooms and not the cafeteria. In the Kindergarten classroom I worked in, there was a young boy who had trouble remaining seated, and the teacher got angry with me. For two whole months, she would scream at me, calling me ""irresponsible"", complaining about ""how I can't be trusted"" and how I must be ""firm"". When I decided to be firm, which was what she wanted, she had another adult in the room at times while I was there. If she felt I was doing something wrong, why can't she treat me like a normal human being? Apparently, she would go around and tell other people that she has to yell at me. I filed a complaint against her to human resources, and apparently they felt she did nothing wrong.",1

6430,"Can someone relate to this or have I broken myself? I need to premise this with saying that I recognise that I drink as it is the only time I don't feel anxious anymore, and it's a vicious cycle. And so, please, telling me that stopping drinking is an obvious step I am taking now and it certainly doesn't help to say this to me now.

Recently, I have been feeling increasingly anxious and paranoid after drinking about things I may have done or said during the night. This is obviously even worse if there are moments of the night I don't remember or if I blackout.

After a recent night out, I dont remember going back home from the club with some colleagues who I am semi close with (im new to the job). There is basically a 200meter walk home that I dont remember.  I asked, and I was told by them that I was very drunk and was vomiting, but other than that it was a great night and we should do it again.

However, I am absolutely convinced that I said or did something bad that night. Just like I'm always convinced I did something bad the previous time. That I maybe told them I want to rape/hurt/abuse someone, or that I was racist towards someone, or that I said a secret. And even if they said that it was absolutely fine, I'm convinced that they are hiding something from me, that they are waiting for the perfect moment to expose me. That they are all laughing/talking behind my back. I feel like I ruminate over scenarios I may not remember or know even happen, so much, that memories almost build themselves in my head and from moment to moment a memory is more and more vivid.

This is not a new thing in my life, I wake up terrified of checking my phone for embarrassing or illegal things I may have done, if there's a murder in the news I check the location to ensure there was no chance it could be me. 

The same happens in my sober life. I convince myself that someone is angry at me so I will spend literal hours looking over a phone chat between us. Thoughts or worries plant themselves in my head and I cannot let them go. One day I raped someone, the next I have cancer. One day I pissed someone off, the next day the past is coming to get me. I'm terrified of getting out of bed as something will trigger panic.

If someone can relate to this then I virtually plead for a comment or chat. I feel like I am losing control of my thoughts and emotions and this goes for sober life as much as when I drink.",4

I have a few close friends in particular who say it a lot to me and to one another, and I just can't say it back for some reason. And it's not that I don't care about my friends, it's just some mental block in my head I guess. Saying it to parents or siblings feels more ""automatic"" in a way I guess, and is therefore less uncomfortable. Such as ending a phone call with ""love you, bye"" ""love you too, bye"".

Tried to quit last year and it went SO horribly i started back at 20mg but my psych feels weak and sensitive compared to before stopping. I have agoraphobia and panic disorder. I finally saw a psychiatrist who prescribed risperidone but i’m scared as hell to take it. I had full body dyskinesia after taking metoclopramide a while back and after i saw that risperidone can cause that as well as tardive dyskinesia I’m terrified.

I got into weed and alcohol not knowing how much it all could exacerbate things.

I'm in legal trouble because things escalated for me. I had just been diagnosed and I was already on medication.

6490,"Bothered By Unhelpful Thoughts? It can happen so easily. You’re trying to concentrate on your work, and your mind wanders off to a completely unrelated topic. Or, maybe you’re about to go on a first date, and all you can think about is how horrible your last few dates have been. 

**Unhelpful thoughts can be distractions or be destructive.**

Your mind is incredible. When you manage your thoughts, you have your mind working for you. Imagine how powerful you would become if you could ignore or replace your negative thoughts! You could accomplish more and get greater enjoyment from your life.

### These strategies can help manage thoughts that don’t support you:

**Maintain space between yourself and your thoughts.** You don’t have to engage with your thoughts. You don’t focus on every person, tree, and car you pass when you’re driving down the road. Most of these things pass through your awareness without you pursuing them further.  
 

● You can do the same thing with your unhelpful thoughts. **Allow them to simply pass on by.**

● Your thoughts are simply something that you experience - you are not your thoughts.   
 

**Recognise that it is your brain’s nature to produce random thoughts.** The thoughts you experience say little about you. It’s the nature of your brain to produce thoughts. It’s always going to give you something to think about.

● Occasionally those thoughts are useful. Frequently, they’re frivolous. Sometimes, your thoughts can be quite disturbing. We have evolved to pay more attention to negative thoughts: with self-awareness we can see them for what they are and then move on.  
 

**Meditation is a helpful tool for understanding the nature of your mind.** The first thing you notice when you attempt to meditate is the random and restless nature of your mind.  
 

● **Focus on your breathing.** When you find yourself fuming about your boss, wondering what happened to your high school friends, or making a mental grocery list, simply redirect your attention back to your breathing.  
 

**Focus your attention on a thought of your choosing.** You can think about anything you choose to think about. You can think about riding a flying bicycle, eating a lemon, or what you have chosen to accomplish today.  
 

● When you’re experiencing an unhelpful thought, you can decide to think about something more useful. **Recognize that you have the ability to direct your thinking as you see fit.**  
 

**Apply logic.** Poor thinking leads to poor decision making. When your thoughts are leading you astray, put your logical mind to good use. Ask yourself what a sensible person, or your role model, would do in this situation. What would you advise a friend to do?  
 

Are negative or distracting thoughts getting in your way on a regular basis? You’re not alone. The human brain loves to stay active and will wander from one idea to another until you take control of it.

**The key is to focus your attention on what you choose, recognize your random thoughts for what they are and allow them to pass.**",0

6495,"I wish I hadn't been born,, help I mean, it's as simple as that.
I'm tired of living like this. Tired of living in general, and everything it involves — interpersonal relationships, people, politics, economy, thinking, expectatives. All that crap makes me feel like shit and I wish I could turn it all off. 

However I don't want to die. That would hurt the people around me. That would hurt my mom. And my little sister. And, unlike other situations, I wouldn't be here to (at least try to) fix it.  They'd be left with the same nothingness that I feel, but worse cuz ofc death of a loved one is worse than just my own personal regrets. 

So I just wish I hadn't been born. That my mom had had a miscarriage — that would've hurt, yeah, but not for long —, or that I'd never been conceived, or something. I wish I was a blank space in the Universe. Something that had never existed. A hole or something like that.
They say energy can't be destructed and I wish it wasn't like that. I wish I could just disappear completely from existence and leave no trace, I wish people would just forget everything about me so I could die without it being a sin. 

Is there a way to stop feeling like this? Cuz the only way to stop existing is dying, and I've already said why I don't want to kms, exactly. Is there a way to avoid it? Can it get better?",1

I started having panic attacks that woke me up in the night (for no reason, like this was before the hell time) and then got diagnosed with GERD within the same month. Developed hypochondria. Had to move to a massive uni to get the degree I wanted, but I was sick and exhausted and working and struggled to make friends. So im alone all the time. And there's always something that's wrong. I had low grade good poisoning for weeks because I didn't notice a fridge issue. I got an ear infection. I still have pretty persistent vertigo, though it was getting better until I got a cold during my finals, of all times.

And that's not factoring in the handful of deeply personal shit thats happened that I'm not going to blast all over the internet.

And then I just sit there, not bothering anyone, because no one can look at me and tell me my intestines are silently spinning, no one can look at me and see my heart beating way too fast and know I'm not breathing.

And certainly no one knows that every fucking day while I try to live my life I see myself in a grave not feeling any physical sensation at all, its almost as if I can see the future, almost as if old me is sitting in bed slowly rotting away, dead and no one has checked up on me for several hours

6515,"Heart/health anxiety Hi all,

30/m/New York

This post is about my struggle with health anxiety and the fear that my heart is failing. 
Might be a long one but would love to speak to anyone who has/is going through anything similar. 

I have had anxiety for years but have been able to deal with it until recently.

4 months ago I had some chest pain which caused a massive panic attack. The only way I can explain the sensation is that it felt like someone was grabbing my heart and squeezing. 

A couple of days later I went to my doctor and had all the necessary tests. Blood work, EKG, echo etc. All results came back fine, as expected, except for the fact that I have an oddly low pulse (53 most of the time) and the chest tightness remained. 

Over the next few months my panic attacks became less frequent (twice a week) and my chest tightness began to disappear.

I managed this by reminding myself throughout the day of any moment where I was distracted enough to feel normal. An hour or two went by and I would be suddenly be reminded that I’m not dying. I feel great. It must all be in my head. 

I had also started weekly therapy during this time but I didn’t find it particularly helpful. My therapist mostly talked for an hour and guided me through breathing exercises. I think what I really wanted was to find the route of the problem.

More recently, my panic attacks have been worse and more frequent. 
I have been feeling heart palpitations a lot, or more accurately, my heart skipping beats.
I began checking my pulse and counting the beats fairly often at this point, causing more anxiety and more panic attacks. 

Now I’m obsessed with my low pulse and my blood pressure machine. Almost all results show high blood pressure with a pulse of 51.
 
I have just had a heart monitor on my chest for 48 hours and won’t get the results back for another 10 days or so. 

And this is where I am at…
Frequent panic attacks and the constant thought that my high blood pressure and low pulse will either kill me, give me a stroke or make me faint.

Anyone else gone through this? 

Thanks!",4
6517,"Easily set off I just want to start this off by saying that I’m aware that I have a problem and I want to fix it. I am easily set off. I mean really easily. 

There are so many instances where I get set off by small/lighthearted comments. At times I have gone off on people for really small things and it has ruined relationships. This is while being relatively “stable” too. What I mean is, this has been when I’m not depressed or manic. Another thing I’ve noticed is that if someone makes a comment that hurts my feelings, it really hurts me. To the point where I become severely depressed and question why I should go on with life if I can’t do xyz and people don’t appreciate me. There have been 2 instances where friends haven’t responded to my messages right away and I explode. One of those instances was when I was manic. I have ruined those two friendships. 

Lately I have been really good about being able to recognize the feelings that I’m having and sit with them instead of releasing all of those negative emotions.

I have got a girlfriend recently its been like 5 months and we meet in person twice or thrice in a month, and I met her yesterday too, when I am with her I pretty much enjoy everything, the feeling of hugging her, kissing her, and just doing stupid things together, but as soon as I drop her home its like all the memories just fade away, right after I drop her home I forget the feeling of huggin her, kissing her. I usually took this for granted all the time but yesterday after dropping her at her home tears started coming out of my eyes because of how much I hated this. I actually don't have anyone to talk about this with neither can I go to a therapist or whatever, can anyone please please please help me a little bit. 
I will appreciate it a lot.

I've been the odd one out since back when and slow on socialising - I can't seem to use social media well (too afraid that my relatives will find it) and/or hold conversations for very long even though I find people with the same interests. I've gotten responses that range from implying that I annoy them or getting told my way of thinking is... strange(?) I'm not sure how to phrase this since I tend to notice my ideas get shot down and nitpicked more than others in my friend group or even project team setting. 

I started withdrawing from my social circles as a result and getting used to living alone with myself. My family been supportive of me thus far and I shouldnt complain but I cant live like this for very long - I want to express myself and find a space for my art, craft and ideas that accepts me for me.
And I'm sure in order to be independent, I need to also be comfortable with myself.

But I'm not. I live life now never crossing the line with people even if I think its a terrible idea and is proven to be for the purpose of avoiding conflict, I withhold my ideas so as to not seem radical or stupid and avoid being berated or talked down. I feel like a NPC living a scripted life.

6541,"SCARED TO BE A PARENT This is me venting? Help any advice helps!



I’ve been diagnosed with BD type 1 for two years and when I got diagnosed it made so many things from my childhood make sense.
I was always so “emotional and dramatic” and known as being a “cry baby” basically my entire life. To be completely honest I truly think I’ve always been bipolar (genetically not necessarily an environmental effect-although my environment didn’t help but cause more spark to the fire) 
Anyway, I’m 27 now and I’ve decided to discontinue birth control. I currently take the pill and have the nexplanon. The combination of the two seemed to help for about five months but since having the nexplanon I have gained so much weight and have become more noticeably irritable. My episodes are more drastic and scare not only myself but others around me. Along with that my depression has gotten worse and pet of that is because of the weight of gained-it makes me so mad. I’ve tried dieting and exercising extensively. I have been told that a k eto diet helps manage symptoms of BD-not sure how true tha is. But I did do the diet for about two months and I dropped weight quick and get on top of the world. Thinking back on it now idk if that top of the world feeling was me having an episode.
I few like my BD has been managed quite well but of course I struggle day to day. 
Everyone here knows how dark bad days can be, you know how it can be. It’s scary as fuck! 
I want to be healthier with minimal medication and I feel like that means no more birth control. I’m hoping it helps me lose weight and decrease my depression. 
I also want to start a family but it worries me that my children could possibly have BD like me. No one is immune to pain and suffering but man having a mental diagnosis sure makes things a hell of a lot harder. 



Edit: the only reason I’ve taken birth control is because my cycle is extremely irregular. Sometimes I have it every day for  months at a time to having it very painfully for a day or two. All birth control I’ve used has helped for about two months until it seems to have no effect on my body. The last birth control I was using was the pill along with the nexplanon. The combination of the two seemed to help for about five months.",2

6544,"How can i best support my friend? ((throwaway because a common friend follows my main account))

Some brief background info:
I have autism so I may not always understand all social cues. Neither my friend nor I live in the US.

I have a friend going through a hard time right now. He has depression and recently has been experiencing all sorts of physcial issues. He's had depression before I even met him and have never seen him this low. He also has money problems and thus can't afford treatment for his physical issues atm. 

What's the best way to support him?
I cannot support him financially since i also have almost no money.
 Whenever i talk to him he gives short and/or snappy answers and is generally in a bad mood. Whenever I talk about positive things, it feels preachy or that I'm ""rubbing happiness in his face"". Whenever i try to talk about neutral things  (basically small talk) the conversation dies off. So he's understandably a bit difficult to talk to as of late.

I admit, it's difficult and hurtful at times but I just want to know what would be the best way to provide my support.

Have you found anything to help with it Because of my avoidance and social anxiety I’ve used the internet more and more to scroll instagram and reddit and just waste time. It’s like being social without any of the stress of socializing. But it’s not good for my mental health long term and worsens my ocd. Anyone found any tricks or tips to get off of it. It sucks cause socializing irl is obviously the best solution but that’s not that easy with avoidance and anxiety,3
6551,"It Consumes Every moment before it’s present. Every thought before it’s thunk. Every emotion before it’s felt. Every plan before it’s made. Every goal before it’s met. It even consumes itself. It mostly consumes itself. Feeding off of itself yet never failing to sustain.

It’s a cloud of rain reminding you that it’s ready to pour if at any moment you decide to enjoy the sun. Some days are all rain. Some days the cloud just lingers, never letting you forget that it’s there. It’s always present. It refuses to be ignored.

It reminds you to stay locked inside so that you never end up getting caught in the rain again. It reminds you not to make plans so that you won’t become disappointed when the rain washes them away. It reminds you to be content in your small space and to be thankful that you’re protected by the safety of four walls and a roof.

It’s suffocating but it’s safe. It’s confined but it’s familiar. There’s no room for growth but at least you’ll never get lost.

At first, people in your life may offer you an umbrella. But you know the umbrella can never guarantee you’ll stay dry. Even when locked away inside- the rain will at times find it’s way to you. Staying inside is the best way to minimize your risk. The rain is too much.

You can’t be disappointed by the things you never achieved if you never sought to achieve anything to begin with. You won’t have to blame yourself for being subjected to the rain if you don’t step out from under the protection of your small roof. If from time to time the rain still manages to make its way in- you can at least take comfort in knowing it was unavoidable, as you did everything you could to avoid doing anything at all.

It multiplies. The more you think about the rain, the more clouds appear. But again, it will not be ignored. The multiplying is inevitable. The more you dread the rain, the more rain comes. The more rain comes, the more you dread the rain. It’s a never ending cycle. It multiplies itself until there’s no longer room for anything but rain clouds and one day you’ll forget there was ever anything but.

It washes away everything that once was, everything that is and everything that will be. Every moment before it’s present, every plan before it’s made, every emotion that wasn’t born from the rain and every goal before it can be met. Serving as a constant reminder to stop expecting more than rain. Eventually you won’t even remember the sun, which in a way may makes the loss of it easier to bare.

But while it cleanses your tiny world of everything that can be seen, heard, felt or thought- it never washes away itself.

It’s always present. It’s impossible to ignore. You have become the rain.

6564,"Imposter Syndrome and anxiety about learning more about this disorder Hi. This post could be triggering to others with imposter syndrome, so I want to start off by saying that these are my own anxieties, my goal here is to know if anyone else has felt this way and if they've been able to circumvent it.  


I was officially diagnosed with BP2 by my psychiatrist in the fall, but had previously been diagnosed with a general mood disorder and major depressive disorder, and a suggestion of cyclothymia from a therapist. Bipolar 2 makes sense to me, it tracks with situations and periods of my life where I was feeling unnaturally confident and ""fun"" in a dangerous way, and more often, the periods where I've been unable to get out of bed or the house for weeks.   


Still, I have this weird fear of learning more about Bipolar Disorder, because there's a part of me that fears that if I read about it in-depth, I might start mirroring symptoms that I don't usually experience. Sometimes this includes even browsing or participating in this sub and r/bipolar2.

I think being medicated with varied success also plays into that, but I also think that's just a common bipolar experience: you find good meds and then you wonder if you're even bipolar. I feel that way when they work, but I keep on taking them. And then I will have breakthrough depression after years of being more stable on meds, and I wonder if it's a sign that I have something else wrong with me.  


So, to those that have survived imposter syndrome... How? Is there a way to not be afraid to learn about your own medically diagnosed disorder... Or to just accept that I have this disorder, without constantly questioning myself?",2

6569,"Why do negative social interactions give me such existential dread? How to cope? I’m posting here because I’m technically diagnosed as bipolar and I suspect it could potentially be related in the form of overthinking.

Overall I’ve had pretty stable mental health since I graduated college and started working. College was hell and now I occasionally get hypomanic but nothing extreme. Even less frequently do I ever feel depressed. All without meds (has bad side effects, didn’t really help, felt like it kept me in a “sick” mindset but I digress). So I think I’m doing great overall. I feel privileged in that way.

But something I still struggle with is this feeling of existential dread I get when I mistake a mistake, am wrong, or am just being trolled.

I have many examples, but one today was someone on an academic subreddit telling me I’m wrong about something and implied I’m an idiot that doesn’t know what I’m talking about. All when this person couldn’t refute what I was saying and was generally being a d*ck focused on me being wrong instead of trying to discuss as a community.

Others have been related to feeling secluded in my field of work because I research a type of illness our product exacerbates to find preventative measures. So sometimes I have to trigger people and if I try to find colleagues to talk to “it could harm the business” which my boss is annoyed about (not violating any NDAs)

But I digress.

Basically, anytime I get shut down by someone one way or another, I have thoughts of just not wanting to continue on. Just being unable to cope with other people. 

I don’t perceive them as being s*icidal, like I wouldn’t act on it or plan or anything. But just a feeling of anxiety and fear from making social mistakes (like fearing being canceled for a misunderstanding). I just feel like I don’t know how to move on. Then I think my hypomania kicks that overthinking into overdrive.

All until I sleep and wake up the next day. Usually, but not always. Sometimes it does lead to dysthymia or depression.

I’ve never really had a lot of friends. I’m married in a great relationship with great (international) in-laws but I don’t have regular friends I hang out with (mostly friendships of convenience, like classmates) nor do I have a good family. I guess I generally feel like I don’t really have people to support me.

Despite being able to get by in most social situations fine, I don’t have a real social life and always feel lacking or like I know how to talk to people in personal. Like I only have enough social skills to survive and pass as normal but maybe awkward sometimes. But the awkwardness and not knowing what to do in social situations is what Sara me up",2

On Friday, I went through a highly stressful event, and endured lots of stress, build up of hormones etc. This acute stress I went through, benefited me! The next day I felt energetic, happy, and overall in good shape. Heck, even my short term memory improved! I started remembering things much more clearly and openly. I learnt a lot that day, and was really surprised by my performance.



The next day, another stressful event occurred.. an acute one aswell. This was *not* pleasant, at all. Endured lots of stress, build up of hormones.. etc :/ why does this happen to me?


Unfortunately, as you'd expect..my situation went downhill *fast*. I started forgetting things, winded up in a depressed mood..found 0 interest in things I enjoyed.. etc..my memory also became worse. :(


(I also experienced a horrible nightmare today too, and slept 12 hours, which is COMPLETELY abnormal).


So now that I've hid this up in my mind for 1 day, I'd like to speak out. I need answers. What is happening here? What happened to me and my brain? Will I ever recover/be happy and will my memory improve like that last time? Please help. I'm leaving this all on you Reddit...",0

These is so much on could go into - but right now I just need to know what to say to him. He went manic today and there was a huge fight, then he told me, I started sobbing, told him I'm so sorry I didn't know - it was the son of a  ex friend (for other reasons) who had been a sister to me my while life, an aunt to him, her son was about a year older. I'm guessing this was grade school, I don't know any details after that he went to his room. I've tried to tell him in here and checking on him but I don't know what to say. Saw him after and asked him what I could do and he said leave him alone. He's had a friend over today thankfully they are watching sports, grilling, whatever, in the basement. What do I do when his friend leaves? How do I talk to him what do I say? He is going to refuse help. He said that we are the worst parents we never taught him anything and don't listen to him and we hate him and lie to him. I know that he gets manic and the anger takes over, he had said in the past he wishes he was dead. But not recently enough to have him committed for help. He'd never forgive me for that anyway. My husband and older son are away this weekend. So it's just the 2 of us. I can't stop crying, I'm devastated and I feel like I did this to him because I dropped him off over there or she would pick the kids up from school and I'd pick him up later.

6618,"Depression and memories of the past Is it normal to think only of negative things from the past or even see the past worse than it was while depressed?

I keep going over a certain experience from the past the lasted for 2 years but it doesn't meet the criteria of PTSD, but there was mistreatment from superiors and bullying from other colleagues but it wasn't consistent, actually most of the time I was treated better except for some situations that I keep remembering till now. 

3 weeks ago I switched to a different SSRI and I started having symptoms like anxiety, panic, ruminating over that experience and feeling worthless which I think were withdrawal symptoms from the old drug (lexapro) 

I noticed that these symptoms come when there is something wrong with the medication or I am going through a stressful time.

I got a panic attack at work and my manager noticed and when I asked for some time off to recover they stalled and then they released an exit visa from the country and told me I would work remotely from my home country but there is no guarantee that they would keep their word. 

So now I am faced with the possibility of going back to my country which is going through a tough time economically and uncertainty about finding a new job. 

I am now back to the old drug I used to take and increased the dosage to 30mg with the Dr's supervision. 

I am not sure if the medication is not working yet or that I am going through a challenging time so I am having anxiety. 

I spend most of the time alone in my hotel room thinking of the past and worrying about the future and I am just exhausted. 

Your insight would be appreciated",1

I don't want to be treated as I need a fucking ramp going up a staircase, or given a discourse of pity like I'm disabled somehow or another because I'm depressed, I just want love — none but love, except — great — that's even more shameful to ask than help itself, and you do it once, you're marked for pitiful clinginess (~~death)~~, so to publicly ask for help is something l'll never dare again — oh no, I won't.

You may find yourself comforted; warmed, even, upon your request for help among friends, but if you're a man with any kind of zeal(or anyone with such vigor; really) then the moment you're elevating yourself up ever so slightly in a competitive manner again, that fragility you've shown is going to be used against you in every single fucking regard, and you'll never make it back to that league you once held your held high on.

So I'd rather suffer proud now, even if it kills me. At least it'll be a literal death – a clean wipe, opposed to this sick sort of castration.",1

But I’ve noticed my anxiety starts 5am waking me up from my sleep with a knot in my stomach, my heart beating out of my chest and an impending doom feeling…then I lay in bed deep breathing. Once I get out of bed I feel better. My anxiety is still there and then peeks from 12-3pm. Then around 5pm I am like a whole new person…no worries..enjoying my hobbies..eating as if I have no worries anymore. But then the whole process starts again the next day!!

Anyone else?! How to stop this horrible cycle",4

6658,"BD and daydreaming When I am stressed, I daydream excessively. 
Daydreaming at times helps me to navigate difficult emotions and situations and gives me perspective.

Sometimes I write my daydreams down as a form of release, it’s not always effective when I am doing it excessively - not enough time.

I am worried I may end up being psychotic again. 

I have been sleeping all day and waking up at 4/5am since Feb 4th.

I guess what I want to know is if anyone else with bipolar struggles with daydreaming and how they cope with it.

6659,"So, I just started taking medicine. Like I said, I'm just now getting medicine for this. I don't think I really needed medicine, but my therapist has been trying to get me on medication since last year. I finally agreed to it, and I took the first dose yesterday morning, and the second does this morning.

I have noticed no changes yet, but he told me that it could take a while before anything really changes. All I've noticed is how paranoid I've been that they are giving me a placebo. I want to get the pills they gave me and open up the capsule just to see if there's anything in there, but if there is then is it medicine or sugar? Maybe it's just some sort of powder that doesn't actually do anything. 

What if they are giving me fake medicine? Are they trying to see if I can change just by believing some miracle pill will do something? It feels like they're trying to disprove my Avpd even though they were the ones to diagnose me. 

It didn't help that my therapist told me that he was excited to see what I look like when I'm medicated. What is that supposed to mean? I can't tell if he would just be excited to see me improve or if he is trying to test me somehow.

I don't know. I think I'm thinking about this too much. Anyone have some advice? Kind words maybe? I'm going to keep taking the medication unless something bad happens, so don't worry about that part.",3
6660,"I’ve recently been having problems with heart palpitations and increased anxious feelings Hi Reddit. I am a young adult female in her first year of university, and I just wanted some reassurance or advice. 
I’ve grown up around anxious people- having parents and step parents on anti depressants and with ptsd, so I know how the gist of mental health issues in this caliber (somewhat haha!). I myself have also struggled with mild anxiety or depression in the past, as well as a brief but somewhat severe ED many years ago, but nothing ever officially diagnosed or bad enough to get diagnosed or treated for a part from some counselling. However in the past few months my anxiety have been ramped up to the max, with the feeling of my heart pushing against my chest for the silliest little fears- giving me insomnia or making me feel sick etc. It’s doing as much as I write this.
One thing to note, I have a heart murmur, and occasionally I can notice it, but normally it’s very faint, if really there at all, so I’m assuming it’s got nothing to do with anything? 
I have been feeling kind of lonely lately. For some more recent context, whilst I play online with my old friends and see them and my bf often, I don’t have any really close friends at uni, and have had some fall outs with a Flatmate I share a bathroom with, making me often anxious in my own home. I absolutely love living away from home apart from this as I came from spilt custody between parents.
I would just like some advice or anyone with past experience to reassure or educate/help me if any way? Thank you so much :)",4

6677,"Did I have a panic attack? About a month ago I (F 25) had (what I think) was a panic attack. I’ve gone through childhood physical and emotional abuse and traumatic events in adult hood (family member has tired to take their life a few times) but I have resisted the idea of getting professional help for myself since I was 11/12 and have only opened up about 90% with my long term boyfriend.

In 2017 I was at an all time low and was feeling like life wasn’t worth it and felt numb to the world. One night after going for dinner with work friends I was walking home and collapsed on the ground. I was conscious but felt so numb my body and mind just gave up there and then. Some people came to help me and called an ambulance for me. When the paramedics arrived the shook me and got me on a bed I didn’t talk but could hear them. I suddenly snapped out of it when they rolled me into the ambulance and started crying. The paramedic pricked me with a needle on my finger to test me for something. It hurt and was unexpected. They said they had to take me to the hospital to check me out but I was sure in my head that nothing was physically wrong with me. I got to the hospital and was so embarrassed and ashamed that I told staff I should leave and I went home. I was so incredibly embarrassed and ashamed and still am. How dare I just let all that happen when I wasn’t an emergency and what if someone somewhere needed help and was dying. I just don’t understand why didn’t snap out of it. 

Fast forward to a month ago. I was at first aid training (ironically) and that machine that pricks your finger was brought out to show us. The instructor used it on his own hand. I remembered immediately what I had done in 2017 and all the feelings of shame, guilt, embarrassment came rushing back. I didn’t think much of it and we moved onto what the readings of the blood would tell you. I suddenly started feeling my hands sweat and a hotness covered my hands and seemed to radiate throughout my whole body and face. I was taking notes and my hand became so weak I couldn’t keep writing. Then I realised my hands were shaking uncontrollably. At this point I was thinking it was in my head but then my heart started racing sooo incredibly fast. I was still sure it was in my head as all I could think about was that I’m not someone who faints at the sight of blood. Then I started feeling like I was going to faint and to my embarrassment I had to stick my hand up and say in-front of the class I was not feeling well. I got up and staggered outside the room and sat on a chair. The instructor followed me , clearly concerned. I then started thinking I was having a heart attack and was about to die. I genuinely started thinking what is everyone going to think if I die right here, my boyfriend, my family. I was telling the instructor that I don’t normally faint and that I felt weird and that my pulse was fast. The instructor took my pulse and told me to slow my breathing (hadn’t even noticed how fast and heavy I was breathing). Soon as he told me that I started calming down and thought if he’s not worried about me dying then maybe I’m not. I started feeling much better after that. At the end of the class he said he reckons it was ‘a little bit of anxiety’. 

Was that a panic attack? Whatever it was it scared me. Since then I’ve had 6 more with varying degrees but the first was the worst. This has pushed me to tell my doctor I need to speak to someone as I’m scared it’s going to happen in public and now I’m being referred to therapy so I’m not diagnosed with anything yet so am clueless.

here are the things doctors have told me:

1- first doctor told me its nothing but a simple sore throat and i was prescribed hot drinks and over the counter flu meds (result: nothing)

2- told me i have GERD/acid reflux and i was prescribed Gaviscon and a few other meds related to this matter (result: felt a lil better but not that better)

6727,"Can stress cause missing hunger cues? I know stress can cause a lack of appetite, but can it cause hunger signals to disappear entirely?

I have been dealing with an extremely stressful situation lately (on a waiting list for therapy atm). The stress has been making me feel I’ll (mostly low energy, sore/achy, headaches and stomach pain). 

I’m used to losing my appetite when stressed or grieving, but with this situation I haven’t even been feeling hungry. Like, I’ll go straight from fine to “my stomach hurts and is growling from being empty” with no warning. At the point when my stomach starts hurting, I force myself to eat something but it is difficult since my appetite is gone so nothing sounds good and it seems counterintuitive to eat when I feel nauseous. When I am able to eat, it is much less than I normally would.

6733,"I’m (29M) having bad anxiety in new relationship I (29M) started dating my girlfriend (24F) around 3 months ago. Almost a month ago we became officially boyfriend/girlfriend, and since then my anxiety has sky-rocketed. 

At the start I used to be pretty confident, always trusted her etc, but now I’m struggling. She has given me 0 reason not to trust her, but I’m always thinking worst case scenario. She is on her phone? Probably talking to another guy. She goes out with her friends? Probably cheating on me. Yesterday we were together in bed and I saw she was looking at some photos on her phone, and could see on the photo reel some pictures I didn’t recognize. The background was red, and that was everything I could actually see (I was without glasses). I immediately started thinking that those pictures are probably with a random guy, and that she is cheating on me. I mean, even if they were photos with someone else (which I don’t even know if they were photos of her/screenshots/ a random thing etc), she can have photos with friends without me thinking this. 

I know this is not healthy, and while I haven’t showed her my anxiety, I’m sure at some point I will mess up and she will probably start distancing herself. I mean, this reeks controlling behavior, right? I even had some issues with my bank that I thought she caused (not at all). This is my second relationship, my first was not great but my ex never cheated or anything, so I’m not sure what is causing this. Could it he that Im insecure? Or just don’t want to lose her? My gf is awesome and I really enjoy our relationship so far. She is attentive, shows interest, always makes time for us, cooks for me etc. I feel loved.

It is worth noting that I almost screw everything up at the beginning, as I broke up with her before we were oficial for another girl. I realized my mistake shortly after and she accepted me back (after apologizing and having a deep conversation with her). I’m constantly thinking that I don’t deserver her after that, and that if I were her, who knows if I would have taken me back. Could this be part of it?

TL:DR: I (29M) started dating my gf (24F) over 3 months ago. She has given me 0 reason to not trust her, but I’m constantly anxious thinking the worst (that she is talking with other people, cheating on me etc). This makes me fear I will eventually become very controlling. How can I address this?",4
6734,"How being outside reduces stress I will explain why being outside is good for your health. Nowadays we are often indoors almost all day because of school and work. There’s not always something wrong with that, but you’ll probably feel a lot better if you go outside every now and then.

**IT MAKES THE MIND CLEARER**

Inside a house, study or workplace there are often many things that make you think about your work or study. There is nothing wrong with this, but it can ensure that you are constantly busy with your work or study. This may keep you thinking and living in your head instead of in the moment. In addition, there are all kinds of other distractions indoors that keep your mind from calming down. So go outside and enjoy the tranquility.

**LESS STRESS**

This tranquility automatically reduces stress. You are not busy with school, your work, or other things. As a result, you go out of your head and into the moment. This will also reduce your stress and reduce the risk of stress symptoms and complaints. In addition, physical exercise is also a great way to reduce stress. When you are physically active you can reduce stress. You probably also feel that when you exercise. And after you exercise you notice that your stress is reduced compared to before you started exercising.

so one of my anxiety symptoms that sometimes happens is that large parts of my body just go completely numb, mostly my arms, legs, chest, neck and face.

Right now it's happening again and even though i know that it's most likely just my anxiety, my brain knows that numb = nerve problem, and that's what i can't get out of my head :/

I am so worried that one day i actually do have something with my nerves, but i ignore it thinking it's just anxiety and then i stay permanently numb because i didn't go see a doctor....

And what if one day i have a stroke and just try to ignore it because ""oooh anxiety""

6751,"Depression from stress? Hi. I’m a med school student who doesn’t know how they’re feeling. I don’t know if I’ve been feeling this way for so long because of my bad grades, which I heavily suspect but something just feels off. Like it’s not the whole picture.

Waking up every morning and getting things done are hard. If I didn’t have classes to go to, I would not move out of bed at all. Getting dressed and brushing my teeth are such a huge effort that it takes so long to get done. I feel neutral or sad almost all the time, like I forgot what feeling happiness is. Watching videos or listening to music would help sometimes, but I don’t find any fun in them anymore. I’ve mostly withdrawn from talking to my friends who don’t know but they don’t suspect anything yet.

I frequently wish I wasn’t alive by thoughts and urges but have not acted on it. Like not wanting to live but not wanting to die. I don’t know what I’m going through or if it’s all just a byproduct of stress and failure. Online tests and the DSM-5 all point to depression but my mind says I’m faking it.

I have managed it all this time with no medicine, and I have been fine with for the most part. The only time my anxiety would rise a little bit is when it was triggered by stress. Which then I knew I just had to balance it out again.

Well, this month ended up with heighten anxiety due to an allergic reaction being around seafood, one week later got a tooth pulled, 2 days later I was fussed at by an ER doctor, and then one week later after that I had anxiety reflux kick back so hard that it cause two days of back to back panic attacks. My anxiety was so bad that I couldn’t eat anything but rice and chicken, no meds, and being around doctors frighten me. I couldn’t manage to get myself out of that anxiety loop. 

Well I was finally about to get some hydroxyzine  for “as needed dosage” 3 weeks later. My anxiety was down back to a manageable level but my fears were still there. I took one 25 mg pill in the evening. I got an euphoria feeling and drowsiness the whole next day along with diarrhea. Then all my anxiety was gone. I can eat food again without fear. I’m not scared to take meds again. 

This is the weirdest Anxiety is the moment I have ever dealt with. However, I’m now pondering if with my anxiety reflux being kicked up it had my stomach and brain a relay lap so when I took the hydroxyzine it suppressed that nerve in my stomach and it help my stomach feel better and then which stop the relay cycle.

I very well know that it's an irrational fear, but I can't get over the strong emotion pulling me from attending work.
Ive tried DBT which hasn't helped.

Its starting to become frustrating now. Worse still is I've had these episodes since the past few months so much so that I've been to work on and off, and not consistently.

6779,"Magnesium for anxiety-related heart palpitations? I have heart palpitations that I’ve been to a cardiologist about for years and have always been told they’re just a result of anxiety. I hear of people having heart palpitations during panic attacks or while feeling anxious, but I have them all day everyday no matter how calm or regular the moment is. I suppose underlying anxiety is still there, as I’m a jittery person naturally. But they’re annoying and distracting. I tried a beta blocker but it did absolutely nothing, my cardiologist says anxiety meds might help but I’m nervous to take any pills I don’t have to.

I heard magnesium helps with heart palpitations but I know nothing about it, how much is good versus bad, what form to take it in, etc… any info is appreciated!

6793,"Feeling like a creep in public/on public transport So I've had this for a long time, but only now have I sort of grasped why I feel like this.

Whenever I'm outside, and especially in closed off public transport like the subway, I'll feel like a creep because I just stare and analyze everyone and everything. The reality is that, when I get anxious I get hyperaware of everything and everyone around me, and when I start starting at strangers, analyzing every bit of their appearance/clothing/posture/etc, I start feeling like a creep. Only recently have I realized that the being hyperaware is where the feeling of being a creep comes from, vs just organically. With me being less anxious lately, I'm more able to just stare off into the distance and distract myself with my thoughts, and then suddenly I don't feel so inadequate/weird anymore.

I know I've thought about this before, and even said it to someone that when my anxiety takes over I literally can't think of anything but the present situation. I'll literally start brainstorming ideas to think about so I can distract myself from what's in my face that second.

Just felt like typing this out and sharing, maybe someone can relate.

6818,"New to this. Need coping skills Hello, I am new to this community, but I wanted some help. 

I’ll start with some context. I’ve always been a person that throws up and a lot of the time it was when I was nervous. This past year tho it has gotten much worse, with a time where I even went to the hospital because I hadn’t eaten in like 2 days and I felt so physically exhausted and dehydrated. At first I thought it was from weed and something called CHS, but quitting weed didn’t really make a difference. I also have delt with this vommiting in highschool before I would go to a party I would get so nervous I would puke. And that was before I ever touched weed.

This led me to go to a gastro doctor who said he did not think it was weed related and instead some inflammation in intestines. I’ve been on meds for that for 3 months but it was getting better and I really started to take my anxiety seriously  so I went to my doctor and they prescribed me an SSRI. I also will start therapy in a few weeks here. For the past month (after about 1.5 month on SSRI) I have been doing better. I hadn’t thrown up for a month, but these past 2 nights I have had very panic attack like feelings and tonight even pushed me to the point where I had to get up from being comforted by my girlfriend to throw up. And I always feel awful about it and like it’s going to just keep happening and I think I get stuck in that cycle.

I have all these memories of the delusions I was having and how strongly I believed in them, and while I know now that they weren’t real (mostly, I still have flashes of confusion) I’m feeling really rocked by what’s happened. I can’t get over how quickly I lost my grip on reality and how dangerous it was. 

I know it’s normal to feel depressed after something like this, but I guess all I’m looking for is reassurance that I’m not alone with this, and that other people have gone through psychosis and come out the other side.

I've never held a job for longer than a year. I've never had a friend, let alone a romantic attachment. Most of my hometown is a mystery to me because I've never gone anywhere or experienced anything. And at this point, the idea of trying to fix what's wrong is scarier than just rotting away on my own.

Sorry for the melodrama. Point being, I'm not in a great place right now and it's just getting worse over time. And I can't talk to anyone about it, because I don't know anyone except my mom, and she really doesn't understand why I can't just force it. To be fair, I don't understand either.

6861,"Feel like a loser because of how broke I am at almost 30 years old I'm 28 right now and I graduated from college in the Fall 2017 with a bachelors degree in psychology and after realizing I wasn't going to do much with that degree as I've completely lost interest in that field. Since 2018, I have been working as a part-time student advisor making less than $20k annually as I was very undecided about the direction my life was going to go and it was like this for 2 years until I decided to return to college to take prerequisite courses for graduate school so that I can get into a data science graduate program. 

I'm currently in my program right now and I have been keeping a 4.0 GPA and this gives me a lot of hope but I've noticed that some of my friends (including my love interest) make much more money than I do and have their own places. My love interest told me that I will eventually get out of my situation and we still had very passionate sex when I last visited him and we exchanged our gratitudes for each.

But its like, I'm very disappointed at myself for allowing myself to be where I am today. If I had known from the beginning just how much my socioeconomic status would affect my prospective friendships/relationships, I would have taken things more seriously and considered a field that was more lucrative when I was an undergrad.",1

- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact

- ""I'm here to help"" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.

- Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5).

6923,"I feel nothing I have all these emotions inside of me that are just trapped inside. I cant express myself the way i want to and its killing me. I show almost 0 emotion every single day and i feel like an outcast. I can laugh, smile, be excited in front of people, but i only do it for them not for myself. When i am alone i get this certain feeling in my head of all my feelings trying to come out at the same time. I hold it in and it feels indescribable, like a literal wave nothingness that washes over me. Then i just hold the blankest face ever, i do this almost all the time except when listening to people and talking to them. Its so hard just observing my life with no feelings. Occasionally it will become too much and i overflow with tears and confusing feelings, but nobody knows this. I get this feeling of laughter and denial that turns into a feeling of sadness and tears. I hate this, i hate myself. I hate that i feel weird being told “i love you” by a family member and being unable to say it back, i want to but i just cant, i don’t know. Im so sick of myself. I dont like it when people do something nice/thoughtful for me because deep down i don’t want anyone to care for me so i can kill myself leaving the smallest impact i can.",1
6924,"Why just why I don’t know what to do anymore i have no friends no family when it comes to trying being strong i do I really do try. But when one succumbs to his own mental thoughts it can be detrimental how one perceives life. I’m currently homeless and have no one to rely on except myself even though im homeless i do have a job and want a future for myself but sometimes its to difficult to move on(and im taking about mentally, (being surrounded by your own thoughts can be detrimental to one’s health)",1
6925,(vent) i cant do this much longer That’s just it. No one cares about the fact there is something wrong with me. They just see it as me being moody and an annoyance who destroys everything. I can’t go on any medication because of it - i’ve tried everything else yet nothing helps. I can’t sleep and these stupid episodes are fucking exhausting. I don’t know what to do and I highly doubt there even is anything to actually do.,2

6930,"Avoiding everything, doing nothing Had a YT channel, got a decent amount of views. Deleted the channel and all videos.

Had an account on an art website, where I spent countless hours sharing art I spent countless hours on everyday. Deleted it. It had the only copies of my art. Last time I sketched was 2019.

Used to game for hours everyday. Deleted all my games and got rid of my console and TV.

Used to play instruments, working on an album. Got rid of the instruments and the songs (100+). 

Tried a dating app outta curiosity, got matches. Blocked them, deleted the app.

Got interviews for my dream companies. Declined them.

Used to love books, reading entire novels front to back in one sitting.  Now my mind goes blank when I see blocks of text. I had to separate the lines in this post to read it.

Ordered food. Cancelled because I didn't wanna be seen by the driver or any neighbors.

Used to play sports and go to the gym daily.  Quit all sports and haven't been to the gym in 3 years.

Having stupid mini anxiety attacks because I'm scared my avoidance of everything is catching up to me and I'll be homeless.

Saving as much money as I can because I refuse to believe I actually have a job or deserve one. Scared that the amount I saved isn't enough and I'm doomed if I lose my job.

Scared that my minor health issues might actually be major.",3

Positive affirmations?
Visualizations?
Breathing exercises?",4
6934,"Prescribed Propranolol(Inderal) So I was prescribed this medication a few weeks ago to go with my mirtazapine for anxiety and my irregular heart rate. Has anyone taking this medication seen a change in their menstrual cycle? I’ve been clockwork every 29-31 days for years. Currently 5 days late, took a test, negative. That medication is the only thing I changed, and my pharmacist said it typically doesn’t cause that. I feel like I’m the only one who’s had this issue 😅thank you!",4

I'm pretty stable on it, but I think I scored a weird little side effect and I'm curious about how widespread it is.  My hair went from having a slight wave to it to being decidedly curly.  Google ""research"" seems to indicate that this is a possibility.  Has anyone else noticed changes in their hair after taking it for awhile?",2

Anyways i’m basically asking for advice because I am so worried about this i’m losing sleep and i literally think about it everyday. on the bus a couple days ago my chest felt really heavy and my throat felt all small because I was just thinking about going on the slide. it’s so annoying as i don’t want to seem boring and i’ll be sad if i don’t go on it, however I am terrified! Not even that scared of the slide more scared of the panic. I hate my brain. Any advice?",4

6942,"Commanding voice I’m wondering if it’s a common experience for those of us with bipolar disorder to experience a commanding voice while in a mixed episode or mania. 

When I start getting up I will hear a voice inside my head that’ll tell me to do things, usually to my determinant. I’ve learned to ignore it but I’ve had to deal with having the occasional commanding voice since I was a teen. 

Does anyone else have to deal with a commanding voice? 

I don’t have too many bipolar friends and the ones I have we don’t really discuss the disorder with each other.",2
6943,"Wrong medicine So I shared in my first post here that my Dr put me on Latuda to help control my Bpd symptoms. I went 3 days with it, nothing major had the Hypersalivation that's listed and some good sleep (finally).

Then my body seemed to betray itself, violently getting sick to the point of dehydration and muscle cramps that took surgical grade narcotics to calm my body down from.

Turns out I am 1:150 that have a sensitivity to one of the ingredients in the medicine. I have now been switched to Vraylar, tonight is day 1. Hopefully it helps silence the million voices in my head and let's me sleep and keeps me from having any violent side effects.

Sorry if I'm just rambling on, Ive noticed this is one of the safer places to talk about these things without judgement or being approached by the ""Internet Dr.s"".",2

6955,"Tired of my anxiety being a burden to others I feel like this is a safe place to vent... 

When I have anxiety episodes (big or small) I get so embarrassed anymore about it. I don't want to put a damper on someone else's day when they are trying to understand why I feel the way that I do. It's also getting harder and harder for me to describe my feelings and reasons for my anxiety. I just wish that I could turn my feelings off, even if it were just for a day. 

Okay, venting over. Let's hope for better days ahead. :/",4
